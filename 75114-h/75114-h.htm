<p>The author’s <cite class="fsnormal">“Descriptive Meteorology”</cite> (Appleton,
1914) is designed for the teaching of those
who intend to make Meteorology a profession. This
book is planned for the reading of those who desire
to know something of the wonders of the New Air
World into which man is just now entering, for those
who desire to become weatherwise and make forecasts
for themselves, and to apply their knowledge
to their business, their health, and their happiness;
and for the reading of the more advanced pupils of
the public schools.</p>

<p>So far as possible technical terms are avoided and
an effort made to tell a simple story that will awaken
curiosity and lead the reader to wish to know more
and more of the mysteries of the atmosphere, of
which practically nothing was known at the time
of the landing of the Pilgrims, Torricelli not having
discovered the barometer until twenty-three<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_viii"></a>[viii]</span>
years later. It will be made plain how atmospheric
air was formed, how long it will remain, whither
it will go, how it is heated, cooled, and lighted;
where and how storms, cold waves, clouds, frosts,
and fair-weather conditions originate and how
move; how the cyclone, the tornado, and the thunderstorm
may be recognized on the Daily Weather
Map of the Government and their future activities
forecast; how a fund of simple yet wonderful information
that will be of inestimable value may
be acquired by any intelligent person.</p>

<p>The author acknowledges courtesies extended to
him by Prof. Charles F. Marvin, present chief of
the Weather Bureau, and by R. H. Weightman,
chief clerk of the Bureau, in the matter of securing
several important illustrations; and like favors
extended to him by D. Appleton and Company,
John Wiley &amp; Sons, and the Taylor Instrument
Company, of Rochester, N. Y.</p>

<h2 class="p2 nobreak lht0" id="CHAPTER_I">CHAPTER I<br>
<br><br>
ATMOSPHERES OF THE EARTH, THE SUN,<br>
<br>
AND THE PLANETS</h2>


<p><b>How Atmospheres Are Formed.</b> Once there were
no such things on the earth as hills and mountains,
singing brooks, roaring rivers and vast oceans; and
the delicately hued landscape, with its winding roads,
hedges, flowers, green fields, and golden grain, had
not evolved from the atmosphere. The earth had
not yet cooled down to the condition of a solid crust,
everything that the eye now sees existed in the form
of invisible gases, or as clouds incandescent with
white heat. Fiery blasts swirled over the face of
the earth. Storms a million times more powerful
than the most destructive West Indian hurricane of
the present day moved through the indescribably
hot atmosphere, throwing down not rain as we understand<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_2"></a>[2]</span>
it, but liquid earth and metal, as their rising
clouds ascended and cooled. It is difficult for the
human mind to grasp the wonders of this.</p>

<p>Small planets cool quicker than large ones and
sooner come to the conditions of a crust and to a
temperature suitable for the development of the
various forms of life.</p>

<p><b>Atmosphere of the Sun.</b> To the unaided eye it
appears as a smooth, bright, quiescent sphere, but
the telescope reveals millions of agitations and hundreds
of red flames that shoot outward to distances
of hundreds of thousands of miles. One can form
no adequate picture of the convulsions of the atmosphere
of the sun. During eclipses, when the intense
glare of its center is obscured, hydrogen flames may
be seen darting outward for as much as a million
miles.</p>

<p><b>Lifeless Planets.</b> The larger a planet the longer
is the time that must elapse before the hot vapors
of rock and metal, which largely compose its early
atmosphere, cool and congeal into a crust, leaving as
a residual an atmosphere of such heat, density, and
composition as to permit of the beginnings of the
forms of life that have inhabited the world. Before
the sun can reach this condition, an indescribable
period will have elapsed, its light will have gone out,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_3"></a>[3]</span>
its heat will have ceased to reach the earth and the
other planets in quantities sufficient to maintain
life, the earth will have been dead millions of years,
and the sun itself will only receive heat and light
from the feeble rays of the stars that, unlike itself,
have not yet ceased to shine. But even then the sun
ever must remain dead, for there is no external source
whence it may receive heat. No vegetation can
adorn it, no water flow upon its surface, neither can
the foot of any man press its soil.</p>

<p>Jupiter, and perhaps Neptune, Uranus, and Saturn,
have hot atmospheres still in violent agitation,—molten
surfaces composed of all kinds of matter,
from which bubble and boil off hot clouds of vapor
that surge about in huge eddies or cyclonic storms, and
that here and there are shot outward in tongues of
fire. The earth millions of years ago had a similar
atmosphere. But when the heat energy of these
vaporous planets wanes, and they cool down, as the
earth did many years ago, the simplest forms of life
cannot be evolved upon them, for they are too far
away from the sun to receive life-giving heat. Mars
receives less than half the intensity of the solar rays
that come to the earth, Jupiter only 0.037, Saturn
0.011, Uranus 0.003, and Neptune 0.001.</p>

<p>In due time—some hundreds of millions of years—the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_4"></a>[4]</span>
cooling of the sun will leave the earth to freeze
and all life to become extinct, unless, perchance,
the oxygen of the air is so far absorbed by its rocks,
or filtered away into space, as to destroy life before
that time. No matter what may be the achievements
of the human mind, what wonderful civilizations
may be developed, what powerful empires
created, or what wonderful secrets of creation discovered,
it seems certain that these all will pass away,
and finally the surface of the earth be as if man never
lived. The dust of ages will wipe out and obliterate
every trace and vestige of the operations of life.
Silence, cold, and darkness will then reign supreme.
But the time of this is indescribably far off in the
future, and man will have ample opportunity to develop
to the highest mental and spiritual estates of
which he has inherent possibilities.</p>

<p>The moon already is dead. If it is formed of
matter abandoned by the earth, as we believe, it
once must have had an atmosphere, a portion of
which was absorbed by its rocks as it cooled, and the
remainder lost as the result of the low power of attraction
of so small a body, which is insufficient to
prevent the darting molecules of the gases of its air
from shooting off into space. The absence of an
atmospheric covering allows the heat from the sun to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_5"></a>[5]</span>
escape almost as rapidly as it is received; and the
long nights of the moon (each as long as fourteen
of our days) during which the sun’s rays are entirely
cut off, permit the temperature of the dark side to fall
to something like -400° F.</p>

<p><b>How Atmospheres Are Maintained and How
Lost.</b> The processes of nature are always adding to
the various gases of the atmosphere in some ways,
and transforming or taking from them in other ways.
On the earth the loss and the gain are so nearly
equal as to maintain at present a nearly constant
condition. Marked changes have taken place, however,
in long geologic periods. Our early atmosphere
probably contained large quantities of carbon
dioxide which were absorbed by the rank vegetable
growth that now forms the coal beds of the earth,
and the slowly cooling rocks that constitute the
crust took in large quantities of oxygen; in fact,
nearly one half of the weight of the crust of the
earth is composed of the latter element.</p>

<p>In consequence it may be said that our present
atmosphere is what remained after the earth had
absorbed its gases nearly to depletion, and after
the lighter gases, like hydrogen and helium, which
seem to have too great molecular velocity to be
imprisoned by the earth’s attraction of gravitation,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6"></a>[6]</span>
had been lost in space. Gases that cannot be held
by the moon may be imprisoned by the earth and
those that can escape from the earth may be held
by the larger planets.</p>

<p><b>Height of the Earth’s Atmosphere.</b> Exact computation
has shown that if the air were the same
density at all elevations, which it is not, it would
extend upward a distance of only five miles. From
laws that are well understood it is known that at a
height of thirty miles the atmosphere is only about one
hundredth as dense as it is at the surface of the
earth, and that at fifty miles it is too light to manifest
a measurable pressure. The oxygen ceases
at about thirty miles and the nitrogen at about
fifty miles, the water vapor being restricted below
the five-mile level. The appearance of meteors,
which are rendered luminous by rushing into the
earth’s atmosphere, and whose altitudes have been
determined by simultaneous observations at several
stations, reveals the presence of hydrogen and helium
at a height of nearly two hundred miles.</p>

<h2 class="p2 nobreak" id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II<br>
A SYNOPTIC PICTURE OF THE AIR</h2>


<p>How much do you know of the great aërial ocean
on the bottom of which you live and in which human
beings are just beginning to fly? Its variations of
heat, cold, sunshine, cloud, and tempest materially
affect not only the health and happiness of man
but his commercial and industrial welfare, and yet
few know more than little of the wonders of the
life-giving medium that so intimately concerns
them.</p>

<p><b>At the Height of Two Hundred Miles.</b> Here is
only the invisible, the intangible ether which, while
too tenuous to be detected or measured by any
appliances of man, is supposed to transmit the rays
of the sun. These rays, coming in the form of many
different wave lengths, and with widely differing
velocities of vibration, produce a multitude of phenomena
as they are absorbed by or pass through
the air, or as they reach the surface of the earth.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8"></a>[8]</span>
The longer and slower waves are converted into heat,
the shorter and more rapid ones into light, and the
minutest movements probably into electricity.</p>

<p>Oxygen and nitrogen, which form the greater
part of the atmospheric gases, absorb comparatively
little of the solar rays, while water vapor, which
constitutes a little more than one per cent. of the
atmosphere and which remains close to the earth,
absorbs large quantities. From the fact that one
half of the atmosphere, including nearly all of its
water vapor, lies below an elevation of three and
one half miles, it becomes evident that the greater
part of the absorption of the sun’s rays must take
place in the lower strata. On clear days the atmosphere
absorbs nearly one half of the sun’s heat rays;
the remainder reaches the surface of the earth, warms
it and in turn is radiated back into the air,—with
this difference: that as earth radiation the wave
motion of the rays is longer and slower than it was
when the rays entered our atmosphere as solar radiation.
In this slower form the rays are the more
readily absorbed. The atmosphere is thus warmed
largely from the bottom upwards, which accounts
for the perpetual freezing temperatures of high
mountain peaks, although they are nearer the sun
than are the bases from which they rise.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9"></a>[9]</span></p>

<p><b>At the Height of One Hundred Miles.</b> The temperature
at this altitude must be that of outside space,
probably 459° F.<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> below zero. Air liquefies at 312°
below, and therefore it cannot exist in the gaseous
state in a region having a lower temperature. When
it liquefies it has the color and general appearance
of water, and about the same specific gravity.</p>

<p>When a piece of steel and a lighted taper are
brought together inside of a vessel filled with liquid
air, the dense supply of oxygen makes combustion
so rapid that the hard metal burns like tinder.</p>

<p><b>At the Height of Fifty Miles.</b> There is enough
air here to refract light slightly, as at twilight, and to
render luminous the meteors that rush with fearful
velocity against its widely scattered molecules. At
this distance from the earth there probably is no
more air than would be found under the receiver of
the best air pump, and, the reader will be surprised
to learn, darkness is practically complete, although
the hour may be midday, for there are no dust motes
to scatter and diffuse and render visible the light
rays of the sun. (See <a href="#CHAPTER_III">Chapter III.</a>)</p>

<p><b>The Darkness of Outer Space.</b> It may be proven
by taking an inclosed volume of air, freeing it of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10"></a>[10]</span>
dust motes, of which there are millions per cubic
centimeter, and then trying to illuminate it; it will
be found that no matter how powerful the light
directed into it, it remains wholly dark. When one
looks upward on a clear day, he apparently sees the
whole universe illuminated; but in point of fact
only the thin stratum of the earth’s air in which
he lives is illuminated. Outer space is practically
without temperature or light. The rays of the sun
do not become either light or heat or electricity
until they encounter the molecules of the air, or the
invisible dust motes, or the cloud particles near
the earth and through interference are transmuted
from etheric vibrations into other forms of energy.</p>

<p><b>The Bacteria of Disease and of Putrefaction.</b>
These rapidly diminish in number with elevation,
and on the tops of the highest mountain peaks
practically none are found. Mid-ocean also shows
but few.</p>

<p><b>At the Height of Twenty-five Miles.</b> Air, light
as it is, has still sufficient density to obstruct the
passage of the minutest wave lengths of light, and
here probably begins to be appreciable the blue tint
of the heavenly vault. At this short distance from
the earth there must be a deathlike stillness, for
there is no medium sufficiently dense to transmit<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11"></a>[11]</span>
sound. Two persons could not hear each other
speak, even if they could live in this rare atmosphere,
which they could not. Here is eternal peace
and no apparent motion, for storms and ascending
and descending currents cease long before this level
is reached. The cold is intense and daylight but a
feeble illumination. There are no clouds.</p>

<p><b>Isothermal Stratum Entered at the Height of
Seven Miles.</b> We know that the temperature
decreases rapidly with ascent—about one degree
for each three hundred feet—until the top of the
storm level is reached, at about seven miles, when
a most wonderful discovery is made: the thermometer
no longer falls as the aviator rises, or as balloons
float to great altitudes carrying self-registering
instruments. The temperature remains practically
stationary, so far as exploration has been made,
which is to the height of over nineteen miles. Major
R. W. Schroeder, U. S. A., flew in an aëroplane to
36,000 feet and recorded a temperature of 69° below
zero.</p>

<p>We have named this region above storms the
<em>Isothermal</em> stratum. (See <a href="#i_fig1">Figure 1</a>.) Its temperature
everywhere is about 70° below zero and it changes
only about six degrees between winter and summer.
Of course we must assume that ultimately the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12"></a>[12]</span>
temperature shades away to practically nothing as
outer space is reached.</p>

</figure>

<p>Scientific and inventive genius is becoming so
skillful in harnessing the forces of nature to man’s
desires that it is reasonable to anticipate that within
a quarter of a century or less human beings will be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13"></a>[13]</span>
nearly as numerous in the air as insects, they will
remain aloft longer, and sail to vastly greater distances
and to higher altitudes. In time dirigible ships
may sail for days and possibly for weeks in the pure
air aloft, carrying millions of passengers.</p>

<p><b>At a Height of One and One Half Miles.</b> There
is little difference in the temperatures of day and
night, except that the coolest time of the twenty-four
hours is during daytime and not at night, as
would be most naturally supposed. This is <ins class="corr" id="tn-13" title="Transcriber’s Note—Original text: 'important inform  ion'">
important information</ins> to an aviator or to the pilot
of a balloon.</p>

<p><b>At an Altitude of One Thousand Feet.</b> In free
air at the hottest time in midsummer’s heat, the air
is found to be as much as fifteen degrees lower than
that at the ground. Almost within arm’s length
of the streets of great inland cities there is a cool
and healthful atmosphere when humanity is sweltering
and dying from heat below. Some youth who
is reading this may develop the genius that will
lift up whole city blocks into this cool and healthful
region. Open steel work below, the first level at
one or two thousand feet above the hot streets,
express elevators to carry passengers, and the climate
of the cool mountain air is accessible to those who
now live in discomfort at low populous centers.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14"></a>[14]</span>
Man is just beginning to disport himself in the
hitherto trackless wilderness of the air. Certain
it is that the hanging gardens of Babylon will be
outdone in the Twentieth Century and the eyrie of
the eagle left far below by those who will live a part
of their time in elevated structures having bases
resting upon the earth; or who will fly to great
distances aloft and remain at whatever altitude
furnishes them the most pleasant and beneficial
conditions, and that they may thus remain not only
for days but for weeks without returning to the
surface of the earth.</p>

<p>Only during recent years have we realized how
thin is the stratum of air next to the earth which
has sufficient heat and moisture for the inception,
growth, and maturity of animal and vegetable life.
The raising of the instrument shelter at the New
York station of the U. S. Weather Bureau from an
elevation of one hundred and fifty feet above the
street to an altitude of three hundred feet has caused
an apparent lowering of the mean annual temperature
of two and one half degrees.</p>

<p>Air is so elastic and its density diminishes so
rapidly with elevation that nearly one half of the
weight of the entire mass of the atmosphere lies below
the level of the top of Pike’s Peak, which has a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15"></a>[15]</span>
height of a little less than three miles above sea level.
It presses with a weight of about fifteen pounds per
square inch of surface, and its pressure is exerted
in all directions, upward as well as downward. An
ordinary man sustains a pressure of over one ton on
each square foot of his surface, but as the air
penetrates all portions of his body and exercises a
pressure outward as well as inward he feels no
inconvenience. If his body could be so tightly
sealed that no air could enter and if then the air of
the interior should be removed with a pump, his
body instantly would be crushed to a shapeless
pulp.</p>

<p>A cubic foot of atmospheric air weighs one and
one third ounces. Water is 773 times, and mercury
ten thousand times, as dense as air. But air is a
more ponderable substance than many suppose; an
ordinary lecture hall forty by fifty feet and thirty
feet from floor to ceiling contains two and one half
tons of air at freezing temperature. It would
contain less at a higher temperature, because heat
expands its volume; it would contain more at a
lower temperature, because cold contracts its volume.</p>

<p><b>Everything Evolved from the Air.</b> Air is so common
that we seldom stop to consider the magnitude
of the force it exerts or the grandeur wrought by<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16"></a>[16]</span>
this invisible architect of nature. In the great cycle
of world building—birth from the nebulæ, growth,
maturity, decay, disintegration, death, and then
possibly back again to the nebulæ—the atmosphere,
be it light and tenuous as at present, or be
it filled with the hot vapors of earth and metal, is
the vehicle and the medium of the builder, transporting
and transmuting, in mysterious ways and
to wondrous forms, the materials of planets. Its
work as a builder may be further illustrated by
showing that the body of man itself returns not to
the earth earthy, as we have been taught, but largely
to the air whence it came. Decomposition is but
the liberation of the aëriform gases of which it is
mainly composed; the residue is but a handful that
goes back to mother earth. Let us take the dried
corn plant; weigh it, then burn it in a closed vessel
so that none of the ashes can blow away. Continue
the burning until the ashes are perfectly white and
it will be found that the weight of the ashes is only
about one twentieth of the weight of the great stalk,
ear, and foliage we began with. What has become
of all the rest? The fire has destroyed it, you say.
No, we can destroy nothing. Remember that;
we can destroy nothing that the Creator has made,
neither matter nor force. The fire has simply<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17"></a>[17]</span>
changed the form of the plant; the nineteen twentieths
that have disappeared have gone back to the
air whence they came.</p>

<p>Thus we see that the body of man, the cereal and
fruit that furnish him food, the structure that gives
him shelter, aye, the many things that please the
eye: the landscape, the beautiful flowers, the green
fields, the babbling brooks, even the rose blush on
the maiden’s cheek,<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>—really come from this wonderful
fluid surrounding the earth, and well may it be
said that the queen of life rides upon the crest of the
wind.</p>

EXPLORATION OF THE ATMOSPHERE</h2>

<p class="p1 p1b pfs80">DISCOVERIES AS VALUABLE TO THE FUTURE AS THOSE
MADE BY COLUMBUS</p>


<p>An entire new world is coming within the range
of man’s vision. Its possibilities for adding to the
health and happiness of mankind are almost limitless.
The geographic poles have been conquered
and the jungles of Africa traversed; and deep borings
have been made into the bowels of the earth until
heat has arrested further progress. The further
exploration of both regions is of the utmost importance
to the coming age. It is not at all visionary
to assume that the heat of the earth’s interior in
near time will furnish the power necessary to do the
drudgery of mankind, give warmth and light to
habitations, and operate transportation systems;
and the New World Above offers pure, electrified,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19"></a>[19]</span>
and highly stimulating air into which helium-inflated
dirigible balloons will sail, and in which they
will remain not only days but weeks or longer, with
their multitudes of people.</p>

<p>While the use of kites and balloons in sending
automatic meteorological instruments far aloft has
revealed more of the wonders of this hitherto uncharted
wilderness of cold and partial or total darkness
than the general public is aware of, only the
outer fringes of the mysterious regions above the
clouds and the storms have been penetrated.</p>

<p>When the manufacture of helium, a noncombustible
gas almost as light as hydrogen, becomes more
general, as seems imminent in the United States,
the dirigible balloon may successfully compete with
the railroads in the carrying of long-distance passengers.
The recent loss of over forty lives in England
by the collapse of the dirigible ZR2 probably
was largely if not entirely due to the explosion and
fire of the hydrogen gas with which the ship was
inflated.</p>

<p>A decade ago, in a number of Chautauqua lectures,
the writer invariably was greeted with looks of incredulity
when he prophesied that within ten years
travelers of the air would take breakfast at the
Waldorf-Astoria in New York and afternoon tea<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20"></a>[20]</span>
on the banks of the Thames. And yet the ocean
already has been crossed by an aëroplane in continuous
flight, and in the near future it is highly
probable that aërial navigation will be safer than
travel by rail or automobile. The hitherto inaccessible
parts of the earth will be sailed over and
closely scrutinized, while travelers enjoy the comforts
that heretofore have been associated with
Pullman service.</p>

<p>In 1862 the English meteorologist Glashier ascended
in a balloon to about the same height as that
attained by Major R. W. Schroeder, U. S. A., who
achieved a more difficult feat when he flew in an
aëroplane to over 36,000 feet. And at Dayton,
Ohio, celebrated as the home of the Wright brothers,
on September 28, 1921, Lieutenant John A.
Macready, U. S. A., reached the unprecedented
height of 40,800 feet. These are the extreme altitudes
to which human beings ever have attained,
but they are only the beginning of explorations into
a vast and largely unknown and extremely cold region,—one
in which darkness increases with elevation
until at the outer limits of the atmosphere no
illumination whatever exists.</p>

<p>The high eastward wind and 69° below zero
encountered by Schroeder are conditions that already<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21"></a>[21]</span>
had been revealed by the work done at the research
station of the Weather Bureau, at Mount Weather,
Virginia, and at other stations in this country and
in Europe, by the sending up of instruments unaccompanied
by observers. Under the direction of
the writer the Weather Bureau liberated numerous
small hydrogen gas balloons in the Rocky Mountain
region, to which were attached automatic instruments
registering the temperature, pressure, and the
hygrometric conditions. As they came eastward
in the atmospheric drift that always prevails above
the storms in the middle latitudes they attained
to great altitudes, one balloon reaching 19.1 miles,
the greatest altitude ever reached at that time by
the appliances of man. Ultimately the balloons
would explode as they expanded under the influence
of decreasing air pressure and the case of instruments
would descend slowly under a parachute designed
to open at the right moment. The barometer
traced a line on a paper cylinder revolving by clock
works, as did the thermometer. The thermogram
gave the temperature that corresponded with the
varying elevation shown by the tracing of the barogram.</p>

<p>In 1898, twelve hundred observations were made
with kites by the observers of the Weather Bureau<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22"></a>[22]</span>
at seventeen stations selected by the writer, during
the six warm months from May to October. It was
surprising to find the temperature often losing as
much as fifteen degrees with the first thousand
feet ascent during middays of extremely hot
periods. The average decrease in temperature per
thousand feet elevation for all stations for all times,
and at all elevations up to 5280, was 4°.</p>

<p>For over five years kites were used nearly every
day in the year at Mount Weather to carry instruments
aloft to heights ranging from two to four and
one half miles, and at times to keep the apparatus
up during all hours of the day, so that a comparison
could be made of the difference between day and
night temperatures. There is but little difference
between midday and midnight at only a few thousand
feet above the earth.</p>

<p>Few are aware that the rectangular kite of the
weather man was the forerunner of the aëroplane
of the aviator. In 1903, while directing wireless
experiments in the sending of messages at Roanoke
Island, North Carolina, the writer saw the Wright
brothers, or their representatives, lying flat upon
the lower planes of what appeared to be Weather
Bureau kites and gliding in the air from the top of
the sand dunes. This was the beginning of real<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23"></a>[23]</span>
flight by man. The ingenuity of the Wrights transformed
the weather man’s kite, strengthened it, took
out the ends, hitched on a rudder, and when the
petrol engine had developed sufficient power with a
given weight, installed it, and flew.</p>

<p>In the future the meteorologist and the aviator
will be closely associated. With a sufficient number
of weather observations made by aviators simultaneously
and well distributed over the United
States it will be possible to construct a daily weather
map on some high level—say the three-mile level—similar
to the map now based upon sea level.
The pressure, temperature, wind direction, clouds,
and rainfall would be recorded and charted for the
upper region clear across the continent. Three
miles is about halfway to the top of cyclonic storms
and probably in the region of greatest activity.
More accurate forecasts would be possible by the
study of this additional weather chart. This <ins class="corr" id="tn-23" title="Transcriber’s Note—Original text: 'co-operation of the'">
coöperation of the</ins> bird man and the weather man in
studying the geography of the new air world will
mark an epoch in meteorological science as far-reaching
in its consequences as were the discovery
of the barometer by Torricelli and the uncovering
of the principles of the thermometer by Galileo,
the former of which was not known until more than<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24"></a>[24]</span>
twenty-three years after the landing of the Pilgrims
at Plymouth Rock. Thus swiftly does the mind of
man to-day explore the hidden recesses of nature’s
mysteries, and with each conquest carry itself to a
higher realm of existence.</p>

<p>In the not distant future, more storm warnings
may be issued by the Weather Bureau for ships of
the air than for those of the sea, for the navigation
of the air must play an increasing and important
part in the coming activities of the world. Science
is becoming so skilled in the harnessing of the forces
of nature to man’s desires and in the development of
mechanical appliances, that it is reasonable to
anticipate the possibility that long-distance travel
over land or ocean ultimately will be almost entirely
confined to the air.</p>

<p>As the result of the explorations of the atmosphere
made by the institution at Mount Weather
there was ready for our fighting air men at the front,
immediately on our entry into the World War, a
fund of useful information concerning a region that
but a short time before was entirely uncharted.
The instruments carried by the exploring kites and
balloons had keen scientific eyes and they recorded
on clock-timed cylinders what they saw. Thus
did the air pilot know much about the direction and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25"></a>[25]</span>
the force of the wind that he would encounter as he
rose, the altitude where he would pass above clouds,
the degree of cold that he would encounter, etc. He
was told that the temperature would fall about one
degree for each three hundred feet of his ascent until
he reached the top of the storm stratum at six or
seven miles, and that if he could reach that altitude
he would observe a most wonderful phenomenon:
the temperature no longer would fall with gain in
altitude; he would enter a cold but an equally heated
stratum, without finding any temperatures lower
than were encountered upon entering the region,
which is always about seventy degrees below zero.</p>

<p>If the aërial explorer could stop his ship and keep
it at an altitude of about one and one half miles for
twenty-four hours he would be startled to find that
the coolest time of the period was during the daytime,
not during the night, as he had expected to
find it.</p>

<p>In the future the traveler in the upper reaches
of the atmosphere will carry oxygen and make the
kind of air that he wishes to breathe, and he will
properly protect himself against the cold of his new
world, which he will find deficient in dust motes and
doubtless entirely wanting in the bacteria of putrefaction
and of disease. There will be no clouds to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26"></a>[26]</span>
obscure his vision; no rain or snow. He will not
often ascend above the region where there are not
some dust motes to scatter and diffuse a part of the
solar rays and give him at least a partial illumination.</p>

<p>Few persons are familiar with the simple problems
of the air which have such important bearing on the
distribution of man into realms above those he has
been accustomed to occupy. They do not know
that the northwest wind brings physical energy and
mental buoyancy because it has a downward component
of motion that draws air from above, where
it is free of impurities, and where high electrification
has changed a considerable quantity of its oxygen
into ozone, in which condition it remains but a
short time after reaching the lower potential near
the earth’s surface. More people die under the
influence of the south wind than under the influence
of the north wind, because the south winds hug the
surface of the earth and become laden with impurities
and are lacking in electrical stimulation. When
inventive man becomes more familiar with the ocean
on the bottom of which he has heretofore lived, he
will not wait for the north wind to bring down to
him the beneficial conditions that always exist higher
up; he will go after them and remain aloft as long
as he desires to do so.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27"></a>[27]</span></p>

<p>The further development of the dirigible balloon
and the aëroplane are among the most important
duties that the engineer of the future owes to civilization;
and the meteorologist must establish the
climatology of the vast untracked regions above the
highest mountain peaks, for here man will largely
disport himself in the time to come.</p>

<p>The writer agrees with the opinion of Major
William R. Blair, formerly of his staff when he was
the head of the U. S. Weather Bureau, but since the
beginning of the World War the chief meteorological
assistant of the Chief Signal Officer of the U. S. Army
when he says:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“With reference to air travel in the future: the
present stage of aircraft development seems to
indicate that long non-stop traffic, both freight and
passenger, in the air will be by means of lighter-than-air
craft (balloons). These craft have much
larger carrying capacity than any airplanes now
designed and will travel across the continent over
several prepared routes, stopping only at important
centers on these routes to discharge and take up
passengers and freight. It is believed that airplanes
(heavier-than-air craft) will ply between these
important centers and the outlying country about
them, thus acting as feeders to the main route,
over which the monstrous dirigibles will operate.
Most transoceanic as well as transcontinental air<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28"></a>[28]</span>
traffic will probably be carried on in these large dirigible
balloons.”</p>
</div>

<p>Lieutenant Colonel Henry B. Hersey, who served
through the World War in the Aëronautical Service
of the Signal Corps, U. S. A., and who also was associated
with the writer in the management of the
Weather Bureau, says:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The fields of the dirigible and the air plane are
separate and there is no conflict between the two.
For light loads, great speed, and quick manœuvering,
the airplane is supreme. For heavy loads,
long distance, ability to remain in the air for great
periods of time, the dirigible is the only air craft
that can fulfill the requirements. Dirigibles will
soon be in use which can start from Europe, sail over
New York, and drop enough poison gas to kill
thousands and make practically the whole city uninhabitable.”</p>

<h2 class="p2 nobreak" id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV<br>
EARTH’S FOUR ATMOSPHERES</h2>


<p>The earth has four important atmospheres and
others of less importance. The principal ones are
oxygen, nitrogen, vapor of water, and carbon dioxide,
each comporting itself as it would do if the others
were not present. There is space between the molecules
of each gas, and therefore it is easily compressed.
A doubling of its pressure reduces its volume one
half.</p>

<p><b>Composition of Atmospheric Air.</b> It is difficult
for the mind to form a picture of the infinitely small
molecules of the air. Let us therefore use terms and
comparisons that will the more directly appeal to
the human senses. First let us imagine each molecule
enlarged to the size of a small grain of sand.
Then with the molecules from one cubic inch of air
transformed into grains of sand we could build a
roadway ten feet deep and one hundred feet wide<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30"></a>[30]</span>
extending from New York to San Francisco. May
one still further grasp the idea of the atom, many
of which are required to make up the molecules? If
so, the imagination has been stretched to its limits
to enable the human mind to comprehend some of
the simplest facts with regard to the wonderful
fluid in which we live.</p>

<p>Sir William Thomson, afterwards Lord Kelvin,
in endeavoring to give relative values that would
appeal to the imagination, said that if a drop of
water were enlarged to the size of the earth, the
molecules of which it is composed would be no
larger than cricket balls, and the smallest about the
size of small peas.</p>

<p>More than a thousand years before the birth of
Christ a great Phœnician philosopher believed
that all matter—solids, liquids, and gases—was
built up from infinitely small aggregations of atoms.
The learned men of Greece enlarged upon his views
but this philosophy passed into oblivion with the
destruction of Rome and the coming of the Dark
Ages, and it was not revived until about one hundred
and fifty years ago. The ancients could not prove
their theory, while we to-day can count the atoms
and determine their size and motions; and, exceedingly
small though they be, we no longer believe<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31"></a>[31]</span>
them to be indivisible in structure. On the contrary,
we know that each atom consists of particles of positive
and negative electricity. The negative electrons
arrange themselves about a positive electron
for a nucleus and, rotating about it as if it were a central
sun with planets, constitute an atom. All matter
reduced to the ultimate electron is precisely alike.
The difference in matter is determined by the number
of negative electrons that are attracted and held
in place by the positive nucleus that is at the center
of each atom of which a particular kind of matter
is composed. Each of the ninety-two elements
which we believe constitute the ninety-two different
forms of simple matter has an atom with its own
peculiar type of nucleus, which nucleus differs from
those of the others only in the amount of positive
electricity it contains. Thus hydrogen, the lightest
of all gases, whose weight is taken as unity in
measuring the magnitude of other gases, has a
nucleus whose positive charge of electricity is only
sufficient to attract one negative electron. The
next element, helium, has a nucleus with a double
positive charge and consequently holds two electrons
or planets to pay it homage. In like manner the
carbon atom contains six electrons; oxygen, eight;
aluminum, thirteen; nitrogen, fourteen; sulphur,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32"></a>[32]</span>
sixteen; iron, twenty-six; copper, twenty-nine; silver,
forty-seven; gold, seventy-nine; mercury,
eighty; lead, eighty-two; bismuth, eighty-three;
radium, eighty-eight; thorium, ninety; and uranium,
ninety-two. The chemical union of these elementary
forms of matter creates other forms. For instance,
the union of two atoms of hydrogen and one of oxygen
constitutes a molecule of water. But the gases of
the atmosphere are not in chemical union; they exist
in the form of a mechanical mixture, each acting as
though the others were not present.</p>

<p>It is important that this mixture of gases that
constitutes our air be maintained in the right proportion.
Only a slight difference in relative amounts
might be disastrous to life. An increase in the
oxygen would stimulate mental and physical activities
and hold the human faculties at a higher tension.
Man would accomplish more in a given time, but
his span of life would be shortened; and too great
an increase in the proportion of this stimulating
element would quickly terminate life. Conversely
an increase in the nitrogen would render all life
more lethargic and man would be slower to act and
to think; and too great an increase would smother
every living thing.</p>

<p>In addition to the gases named, the air contains<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33"></a>[33]</span>
small amounts of many other substances,—argon,
nitric acid, ammonia, ozone, xenon, krypton, and
neon; as well as organic matter, germs, and dust
in suspension. Over the land it contains sulphates
in minute quantities, and over the sea and near
the seashore salt left from the evaporated spray.</p>

The proportion of each component of the atmosphere
by volume of the total atmosphere is different
from its proportion by weight. The percentages for
the more abundant gases are as follows:

<p><b>Nitrogen.</b> Its principal functions are to dilute
the oxygen and to furnish food to vegetation. It
is inert and does not manifest many marked chemical
affinities. Its lack of activity is shown by the
fact that it will neither support combustion nor
burn.</p>

<p><b>Oxygen.</b> Oxygen, unlike nitrogen, is an active
element that readily enters into chemical combination
with many other elements, and it is second in
quantity to nitrogen. With hydrogen it constitutes<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34"></a>[34]</span>
eight ninths, by weight, of water; combined
with other elements it constitutes forty to fifty per
cent. of the crust of the earth. It burns so readily
that were it not greatly diluted by an inert gas
like nitrogen it would be difficult if not impossible
to stop a conflagration when once started. It is
the vitalizing principle in all forms of life. By its
chemical union with carbon in the tissues of plants
and animals it develops the energy manifested in
their movements.</p>

<p>In the free air up to about seven miles high there
is no variation in the proportion of oxygen. But
variations of marked importance to health and life
occur in places where ventilation is restricted, and
especially where living creatures exist in closed
rooms, and where combustion occurs in confined
places. The following variations in percentages by
volume were found in careful analyses by Robert
Angus Smith: On the seashore of Scotland, 20.99;
open places in London, 20.95; in a small room where
a petroleum lamp had been burning six hours, 20.83;
pit of a theater at 11:30 <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span>, 20.74; in a court
room, 20.65; in mine pits, 20.14. He took samples
from one mine that showed 18.27, the candles going
out when the amount had decreased to 18.50.</p>

<p>The absorption of oxygen by putrid matter and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35"></a>[35]</span>
by living beings in the process of breathing, and the
giving out of carbon dioxide by both explain the
deficiency of oxygen that is found over large cities,
which is more marked when the air is moving but
little and where the city is located in a depression or
near swampy lands.</p>

<p>Both animals and plants inhale oxygen and exhale
carbon dioxide with the unchanged nitrogen.
The process automatically proceeds both night and
day. It should not be confused with the opposite
action of plants under the influence of sunlight in
taking in and decomposing carbon dioxide and expelling
pure oxygen.</p>

<p><b>Carbon Dioxide.</b> It forms the chief food supply
of all green-leaved plants. It is as necessary to the
life of vegetation as is oxygen in the supporting of
animal life. In the ratio of seventy-seven to one
hundred there is less of this gas present in the atmosphere
in the winter than in the summer; there
also is a diurnal maximum and minimum. In the
open country the amount averages about 0.035 per
cent. by volume. In cities the amount is considerably
greater, frequently rising to 0.07, and at times
to 0.10 when the wind velocity is too low to scatter
the excess amount that accumulates near the ground.
Any quantity in excess of 0.06 per cent., especially<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36"></a>[36]</span>
if combined with the organic matter exhaled from
the lungs and from the pores of the skin by animals
and man, is injurious to health. Angus Smith
found as much as 0.32 per cent. in crowded theaters,
and 2.50 in mines. The latter amount soon would
destroy animal life.</p>

<p>Vegetation, in addition to the inhalation of oxygen
and the expiration of carbon dioxide at all hours,
absorbs the latter during the day, and under the
influence of sunlight the green granular matter that
constitutes the chlorophyll of the cells of the leaves
decomposes it, the plant retaining the carbon and
giving out the oxygen. Because of the absence of
sunshine the chemical activities of the plant are
altered at night and the absorption of carbon dioxide
ceases; therefore over the land the maximum
amount occurs during the nighttime. This gas is
dissolved in sea water and given off with a rise in
temperature, which causes the maximum amount
over oceans to occur at midday.</p>

<p>Carbon dioxide is 1.50 times as dense as an equal
volume of atmospheric air. Its greater density
causes it to collect in mines, sewers, cellars, and
other low places, unless there is forceful ventilation.</p>

<p>The American cold wave should be welcomed as
the mighty scavenger of the air. Its high velocity<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37"></a>[37]</span>
and great density cause it to search into cracks,
crevices, sewers, and cellars and expel foul accumulations.
How sweet and clean the air smells and how
vigorous physically and buoyant mentally one feels
after a rain and high winds! All nature smiles and
every form of life adds its pæan of joy. Rain washes
out the carbonic acid gas (carbon dioxide) from the
air, with dust and other particles in suspension;
and the cold wave enters our places of habitation
and drives out the thieving accumulations of poisonous
gases that would rob us of health and maintain
conditions of morbidity.</p>

<p>It cannot be too forcefully stated that oxygen, the
life-sustaining principle of the air, decreases, and
carbon dioxide, a poison, increases in air that is
breathed, or in air in which lamps or gas jets are
burning; and that all places of habitation, especially
sleeping rooms, should have a continuous supply of
fresh air.</p>

<p><b>Water Vapor.</b> It is only a little over one half as
dense as atmospheric air. In the arid regions of
the west it may form only a fraction of one per cent.
of the air by weight; while in the humid regions in
the eastern part of the United States it may constitute
as much as five per cent. The temperature
being the same, the same amount is required to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38"></a>[38]</span>
saturate a given space, whether it be a vacuum or
whether it be filled with air. Air doubles its capacity
for water vapor with each increase of eighteen
to twenty degrees. On a hot day in summer, near
large bodies of water, it may constitute as much as
one twentieth by weight of the lower air, while on
a cold day in winter it may form no more than one
thousandth part. When the air contains all the
water vapor it can hold, it is said to be saturated;
no more can be added to it until its temperature is
raised, and but a slight lowering of its temperature
will precipitate a part of its water vapor in the form
of dew, frost, rain, hail, or snow. This is the reason
it is usually called water vapor instead of a gas.
Under the influence of heat that is below the freezing
point, ice and snow may be changed from the solid
to the gaseous form, and water vapor may be precipitated
as frost or snow without passing through
the liquid state.</p>

<p><b>The Dew Point</b> is the temperature of saturation,—the
temperature to which a body of air must be
reduced before condensation can occur and some of
its water vapor return to the liquid or solid state.</p>

<p><b>The Relative Humidity</b> is expressed in percentages
of the amount necessary to saturate. At a temperature
of 32° air may continue to increase its vapor of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39"></a>[39]</span>
water until it contains 2.11 grains per cubic foot, when
it will be saturated and its relative humidity be
one hundred per cent. If this same air be suddenly
raised in temperature to 51° its capacity per cubic
foot will be increased to twice what it was at 32°,
the 2.11 grains will be equal to only one half the
number necessary to saturate, and the relative
humidity be expressed by fifty per cent. instead of
one hundred per cent. In this way does the capacity
of air for water vapor increase. Thus it is
seen that the relative humidity of the air may increase
during the cooling of nighttime without the
addition of any vapor of water, and, in fact, with a
decrease. The increase of relative humidity after
nightfall is greater in the country than in the city,
where the presence of pavements and brick buildings
retards the loss of heat.</p>

<p><b>The Absolute Humidity</b> is expressed in grains the
cubic foot. The hygrometer is employed to measure
the amount of water vapor.</p>

<p><b>Hydrogen</b> is the lightest of all known gases. Its
density in comparison with ordinary air is only
.0692. It is combustible, and when five volumes of
atmospheric air are mixed with two volumes of
hydrogen the mixture explodes when ignited. It is
supplied to the air by active volcanoes and in other<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40"></a>[40]</span>
ways, but the speed of its molecules is such that it
readily escapes from the earth’s attraction and
passes outward into space.</p>

<p><b>Ozone</b> (Greek, ozo, I smell) is highly electrified
oxygen, in which the molecules are broken up and
reformed so as to contain additional atoms. It
is formed by the disruptive discharge of lightning
and by the great amount of electricity present
in the high levels of the atmosphere, and
possibly in minute quantities by the evaporation
of fog and water near the earth. It is always found
in the presence of waterfalls and spraying fountains.
It is a powerful sanitary agent, readily entering into
union with decaying matter. This fact accounts
for the total absence of ozone from the air of large
cities.</p>

<p>Ozone, in the minute quantities found in nature,
is healthful, but when breathed in a condensed
form it has a highly irritating effect on the mucous
surfaces of the respiratory passages, and the quantity
is not large that will cause death. The healthfulness
of mountain air may be due largely to the increase
with elevation in the quantity of ozone and electricity
in the air, as well as to the less number of
disease germs and dust motes. The invigorating
effects of the crisp air of the frosty morning and of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41"></a>[41]</span>
the cold wave in winter may be increased by the
activities of ozone.</p>

<p>Ozone has two daily maxima, the principal one
occurring between 4 and 9 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span> The minima
occur between 10 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span> and 1 <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span>, and between
10 <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span> and midnight. The winter furnishes an
amount greatly in excess of the summer, due not
only to the less amount of decaying matter to take
up the ozone in winter, but to the higher and more
persistent winds mixing the lower and upper air.
The amount is greater over the sea than over the
land, probably due to the absence of oxidizable matter,
which allows the ozone to accumulate over the
water. It is more abundant with westerly than
with easterly winds, due to the fact that westerly
winds have a downward component of motion; but
if the westerly winds be weak and the easterly winds
come from over a large body of water the conditions
may be reversed.</p>

<p><b>Microbes of the Air.</b> The air transports vast armies
of unseen workers. Some are enemies; others are
benefactors of the human family. The useful
varieties are energetic in clearing away the refuse of
animal and vegetable life, in fixing fertilizing gases
in the soil, in giving flavor to fruits and proper
growth to leguminous crops, in transforming the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42"></a>[42]</span>
crudest must into the best claret, and the poorest
tobacco leaf into the fragrant Havana; in curing
cheese and butter and fermenting beer, and in a
multitude of other useful employments. The malevolent
varieties, if they gain lodgment in suitable
human tissues before sunlight weakens their virility,
disseminate certain forms of disease.</p>

<p>In picking a permanent place of abode, remember
that there are many less disease microbes in the air
of the open country than in that of the city, and
that few are found in the air of mountains, or in
that of the ocean. The average number of bacteria
in a cubic meter of air in the city of Paris has been
found to be 4790, while ten miles away in the country
the number was only 345.</p>

<p>Accurate analyses of the air of crowded tenements
always have shown large numbers of bacteria, but
the number was found to be small in well-ventilated
city houses that let in an abundance of sunshine to
their interiors. It is better to have color in the
cheeks of the occupants than in the furnishings of
a house. Curtains and heavy drapery not only
furnish a refuge for the microbes of disease, but they
may be so hung as to exclude the purifying sunshine.
The amount of sunshine is nearly as important as
the quantity of air, for most of the microbes of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43"></a>[43]</span>
disease quickly die, or are rendered less virulent,
under its influence.</p>

<p>Bacteria exist in small numbers, if at all, at altitudes
where snow forms, but snow gathers them as
it falls through the lower air. Ice contains bacteria,
but not in any such quantity as the water from which
it freezes. Ice forms in the open at the surface of
the water, or about numerous small particles of matter
in suspension, which rise at once to the top as soon as
the ice congeals about them in the form of a buoyant
covering; meanwhile sediment is continually settling
to the bottom, carrying bacteria with it. Ice forms
more readily in quiet water, where sedimentation
has been most rapid, and where, therefore, there are
the fewest bacteria in position to be included. More
disease germs exist in river water in winter than in
summer, which may be due to the greater disinfecting
power of the sun’s rays during summer.</p>

<p><b>Dust Motes of the Air.</b> As the earth pursues its
course about the sun, dust rains into its atmosphere
from outer space. Meteors that are burned
through the heat generated by striking into our air
contribute to the supply, as do volcanoes, combustion,
spray from the ocean, and matter lifted
up by the action of the wind.</p>

<p>Dust from the eruption of Krakatoa was wafted<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44"></a>[44]</span>
entirely around the earth, falling upon the decks of
ships in all the seas of the world. It affected the
colors of the sky for two or three years after the
explosion.</p>

<p>As in the case of microbes, the number of dust
particles is far greater in cities than in the country,
being least on high mountain tops and over the
oceans. The air in large cities invariably shows
hundreds of thousands of dust motes to the cubic
centimeter, that of the village thousands, and that
of the open country some hundreds. Dust-free air
is also germ-free. Many experiments have shown
that air freed of dust motes has at the same time
been cleared of the microörganisms that cause
disease, putrefaction, and fermentation; and that
germ-free flesh or liquids may be indefinitely exposed
in such air without fermentation or decay.</p>

<p><b>How Dust Motes Are Counted.</b> Many of the
particles are too small to be seen by the highest
powers of the microscope, yet Aitken, by a most
ingenious method of making them centers of condensation—that
is, making them the nuclei of small
raindrops—was able to count the number in a given
volume of air. When ordinary air is saturated and
then cooled the cloud formed is so dense that it is
impossible to count the tiny droplets that form the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45"></a>[45]</span>
cloud. But we can make the number of dust particles
(and therefore the number of visible points of
condensation) in a given volume of air as small as
we wish by mixing a little dusty air with a large
amount of dustless air, and we can allow the particles
to fall on a bright surface and can count them
by means of a lens or microscope. By simply allowing
for the proportion of the dustless to the dusty
air, and making a corresponding allowance for the
dilution, we calculate the number of particles.</p>

<p><b>Dust Motes and Illumination of the Atmosphere.</b>
One of the most important functions of dust motes
is the diffusion or scattering of sunlight. What a
different world this would be without these tiny
inanimate friends of man! If there were no dust in
suspension in the air, nothing would be visible except
what received direct light, or light reflected
from some illuminated surface, and the air occupying
space between illuminated objects would be
practically dark. If the observer be in a room with
a powerful electric light he would see the walls
and the objects in the room, but if the air were free
of dust motes, he would find that the space between
him and the walls and between the various objects
would be as inky black as is the space between the
twinkling stars on a clear night.</p>

<p><b>Dust Motes Prolong Twilight.</b> The bending or<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47"></a>[47]</span>
refraction of light as the sun’s rays pass obliquely
through the air at sunrise and at sunset displaces
the apparent position of the sun, elevating it by an
amount about equal to its own apparent diameter,
so that one may see it and receive its light when
geometrically it is entirely below the horizon. A
little later in the evening and its rays fall upon the
upper air too obliquely to be bent down to the earth
by refraction; but darkness does not yet ensue, for
the rays are scattered by the dust motes and possibly
by the molecules of the gases and sent downward
from particle to particle, resulting in a soft
shimmering light that almost imperceptibly fades
away, and which in higher latitudes may last for
hours.</p>

LIGHT, HEAT, AND TEMPERATURE</h2>

<p class="p1 p1b pfs80">MORE WONDERFUL THAN ANY FICTION ARE THE FACT
OF INVISIBLE LIGHT, AND THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN
HEAT AND TEMPERATURE</p>


<p>The heat that escapes from the earth’s interior
is minute in comparison to that received from the
sun, which is the main source of the earth’s supply.
Heat is manifested by the motions of the molecules
of matter, whether solid, liquid, or gaseous. It is
transmitted through space in some mysterious manner,
for space is practically void of an atmosphere.
One cannot conceive of motion taking place in a
void, for there is nothing to move. Therefore it is
assumed that interstellar space must be filled with
a transmitting medium; to this the name of ether
has been given. Nothing is known of its structure,
but it is believed that it penetrates all bodies and
fills the space between their molecules.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49"></a>[49]</span></p>

<p><b>How Heat and Light Reach the Earth.</b> The heat
of the sun is some forty-six thousand times as intense
as is the heat of the earth. The violent agitations
of the molecules of the sun’s hot atmosphere impart
vibrations to the ether of space, which decrease in
effectiveness inversely as the square of the distance;
that is to say, that if the earth were twice as far from
the sun as it is, the intensity of the solar rays would
be one fourth of what they are now. These vibrations
are called solar energy. They pass through
space without perceptibly warming or lighting it.
When they encounter the molecules of the earth’s
atmosphere, and the dust and cloud in suspension
in the air, or impinge upon the solid matter of the
earth, they are transmuted back into molecular
agitations, and manifest themselves in a multitude
of forms, such as heat, light, chemical rays, electricity,
etc.</p>

<p><b>The Difference between Heat and Temperature.</b>
The agitation of the molecules of a substance set up
by the absorption of heat is indicated by temperature,
which gives no measure of the quantity of heat absorbed,
the quantity varying widely for different
kinds of matter. The amount of heat necessary to
raise one pound of water 1° F. is the heat unit generally
employed in commerce; but in scientific<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50"></a>[50]</span>
research the amount necessary to raise one gram
of water 1° Centigrade is the unit of heat best adapted
to use. It is called the gram-calorie.</p>

<p>Let us take a glass filled with boiling water. You
see the glass and the water because they reflect
to the eye light waves received from some source,—possibly
the sunlight that is diffused by the dust
motes of the air into the room through the window.
But the glass and the water radiate other waves to
which the eye is not sensible; these invisible long
heat waves may be felt by the nerves of the hand.
They warm all matter upon which they fall by adding
to the agitation of the molecules of which it is
composed; but they do not warm all matter equally.
The waves that reach dark bodies are broken up;
that is to say, absorbed. Their energy is transmuted
into sensible heat, and in the place of the
waves we have molecular vibrations in the matter,
which are made manifest by a rise in its temperature.
Dark rough surfaces more completely absorb the
waves and therefore rise to a higher temperature
than the same surfaces when smooth. When the
waves encounter bright and highly polished surfaces
the effect is quite different; then most of them
are reflected away and therefore warm the matter
but little. These reflected waves are not broken<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51"></a>[51]</span>
up, but on the contrary start off in some new direction,
possibly falling upon and warming some
matter more receptive to their influence. The
higher the polish the more completely are the waves
reflected.</p>

<p><b>Difference between Light Waves, Heat Waves,
and Sound Waves.</b> The light and the heat waves
of the ether are infinitesimal ripples as compared to
the backward and forward pulsations that constitute
the sound waves of the air. Within a space
of one inch there are sixty-six thousand of the violet
waves of light, which are the shortest etheric vibrations
to which the human eye responds, and
over thirty thousand of the red waves, the longest
that affect the eye; while the sound waves of the
air vary from about one foot for the shrill notes of the
human voice to four feet for the middle C of the pianoforte.
A shrill whistle produces waves of about one
half inch. There are twenty-two thousand of certain
heat waves to the inch, and these, like some of the
light waves of the ether, are invisible.</p>

<p>There is also a vast difference between the velocity
of vibration of the air waves and those of the ether.
The human ear is sensitive to sound waves of somewhere
between twenty-nine per second to thirty-eight
thousand per second; while the eye responds to light<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52"></a>[52]</span>
waves of from five hundred million to one billion per
second. Some ears are better adjusted to the low
vibrations and some to the high, and the ears of no
one hear any but a small part of the melody of a great
symphony. Tyndall could hear the sharp chirp of
thousands of insects that were inaudible to his guide
as the two climbed the Alps, but the guide’s ears
responded to the long, slow waves that came from
the dull tread of the donkey’s hoofs farther up the
mountain, which waves the scientist was unable to
hear. Likewise some eyes are able to penetrate
far into the violet, or the red, or both, and some are
unable to distinguish between certain colors.</p>

<p><b>Chemical Rays of Light.</b> The chemical or photographic
rays have still shorter waves than the violet.
They produce special physiological effects in
vegetable and animal tissues, and, acting upon
particular kinds of matter, they cause fluorescence,
which is the property possessed by some bodies of
giving off, when illuminated, light of a color different
from their own and from that of the light that
illuminates them. These chemical rays are sometimes
called ultra-violet rays.</p>

<p><b>Invisible Light.</b> From a reading of the immediately
preceding paragraphs one may be prepared
for the startling statement that there is such a thing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53"></a>[53]</span>
as invisible light. Vibrations of the ether that
move slower than those that give to the eye the
sensation of red are invisible, as are those that move
faster than the violet rays, and it is certain that
neither the eye of man nor of animal ever will see
but a small part of the beauty of a landscape or the
delicate coloring of a flower. The eye only takes in
and renders sensible to the brain the red, orange,
yellow, green, blue, indigo, violet, and their various
tints, but the delicate instruments of science reveal
many other colors. One sees as through a glass
darkly, for the gentle signals that might reveal the
beauties of Paradise fall upon the eye unheeded.
A keener vision and a more complete appreciation
of the beauties and the wonders of the universe await
one on the other side of the gauzy veil of immortality.
The finger tips of the outstretched arms may
span the river of life and the ethereal breath of
loved ones may be caressing one’s cheek. The music
of the spheres is not a myth; the lily or the rose as
it opens its petals to receive the benediction of the
morning sun may give forth a veritable pæan of
joy. A rose bush may be a grander symphony
than anything that Beethoven ever wrote. What
to us is the invisible light may be the illumination
that guides the sweep of the angels’ wings.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54"></a>[54]</span></p>

<p><b>How Heat Moves through or Is Transmitted by
Matter.</b> Heat passes by contact from the warmer
to the colder molecules of a body. This action is
called conduction. When one end of a bar of iron
is held in a fire, the end away from the fire soon
becomes too hot to hold in the hand, because heat
is rapidly transferred from the hot portion of the
bar to the cooler portion by conduction, showing
that iron is a good conductor. On the other hand,
the end of a stick of wood can be held in the fire
until it is completely consumed without the other
end becoming too warm to hold, indicating that
wood is a poor conductor. Metals are the best
conductors, silver leading the list, with copper
second. Snow and ice and fibrous and porous
substances are poor conductors, and are called
insulators. Air and water are also poor conductors.
The fur of animals and the feathers of birds protect
against the rapid loss of heat because they contain
numerous interstices filled with air, a poor conductor.
Heat is lost by radiation when the molecules
of matter set up vibration in the ether. The
atmosphere itself performs this function on a large
scale when the sky is cloudless, so that radiated
heat is not absorbed by the cloud covering and its
loss into space restricted. When air or water is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55"></a>[55]</span>
not evenly or homogeneously heated a circulation
is set up in which the colder part settles down and
the warmer rises. This is called convection. The
air that is heated by contact with a stove rises and
passes along the ceiling to the colder parts of the
room, gradually parting with its heat until it is no
warmer than the air next adjacent to it, and slowly
settling to the floor as the cold air beneath it moves
toward the stove, is warmed and sent aloft, the first
air finally making a complete circuit and returning
to the stove again. In this way the heat is distributed
by convection throughout the whole room.
When one part of the earth’s surface becomes hotter
than another a similar action takes place on a
large scale. The region of greater temperature
warms the air above it, and the surrounding denser
air flows in along the surface, forcing the lighter air
to rise, when it in turn is similarly warmed and
driven up.</p>

<p>The clear waters of lakes and rivers and of the
ocean permit the passage of heat waves to a considerable
depth before they are completely absorbed.
On a cold day in winter, when the sun is shining
brightly, a room with spacious windows may become
as warm as though heated by a furnace, simply by
the capacity of the glass in the windows to transmit<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56"></a>[56]</span>
the heat waves of the sun without considerable absorption,
and at the same time prevent the escape
of the longer heat waves that are radiated from the
interior walls of the room. This capacity of matter
to transmit heat waves without absorption is
called diathermancy. The clear atmosphere is an
exceedingly good transmitter, and rock salt is one
of the best of all solids.</p>

<p>The capacity of a body to transmit light without
absorbing it and becoming luminous is called transparency.
Air freed of dust motes is almost perfectly
transparent. In this state it is said to be
optically pure. But the ordinary air of nature, with
its moisture and dust, absorbs most of the blue
wave lengths and also many of the longer ones of the
other colors of the spectrum.</p>

<p>The capacity of a body for heat is called its specific
heat. With but few exceptions the specific heats of
liquids are much greater than those of solids or
gases. It requires ten times the quantity of heat
to raise a pound of water one degree that it does
a pound of iron. Ice has the greatest specific heat
of any of the solids, except paraffin and wood.</p>

<p>When a solid is melted or a liquid vaporized a
large amount of heat becomes latent, insensible to
the touch; it disappears as heat. This is one of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57"></a>[57]</span>
the most wonderful of the phenomena of nature.
It matters not how long the time may be, an hour,
a day, a year, or a thousand years after the solid is
melted or the liquid turned to vapor, so soon as the
vapor returns to the liquid state or the liquid to a
solid condition, the latent heat becomes sensible in
exactly the same degree in which it previously
existed. Let us illustrate with a pound of ice at
zero F. Sixteen heat units, or sixteen times as
much heat as is required to raise one pound of water
one degree, must be absorbed by this pound of ice
to raise its temperature to the melting point (32°);
and then one hundred forty-four more heat units
must be absorbed to so far overcome the tendency
of the molecules to adhere, or remain together,
that the molecules may roll the one about the other
in the liquid form, but with this important difference:
the one hundred forty-four units become
latent and do not, therefore, cause any increase in
temperature, as the sixteen heat units did in raising
the temperature of the ice. The large quantity of
heat required to change the ice to a liquid is called
the latent heat of melting. Any further addition
of heat after the melting is complete causes an
increase in temperature, and one hundred eighty
heat units will raise it to the boiling point. Water<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58"></a>[58]</span>
boils at 212° at sea level and normal pressure; that
is to say, at that temperature the agitation of the
molecules of water is so great as to overcome both
cohesion and the weight with which the air presses
down upon them, and cause them to fly away in the
form of steam, which is invisible when confined
inside a boiler. But the entire pound of water is
not instantly changed to the gaseous condition, for
with the sending off of the first few molecules some
heat is rendered latent, and more must be supplied
or the boiling ceases; in fact the enormous quantity
of 964.62 heat units must be supplied to entirely
change the pound of water to steam, but at no time
does the temperature rise above 212°. As in the
former case of changing the solid to a liquid, a large
amount of heat becomes latent; in this case it is
called the latent heat of vaporization.</p>

<p>Now carefully fix in the mind that a liquid does
not need to be raised to its boiling point before
vaporization begins, for it operates at all temperatures,
even after the liquid is frozen, but much
more rapidly from the liquid. If one wishes to test
this: weigh a piece of ice during very cold weather.
Then leave it out in a temperature that is below
freezing for several days, and on weighing again it
will be found that the ice has lost weight. All<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59"></a>[59]</span>
evaporation produces a cooling effect because of the
heat that is rendered latent in the process of changing
the liquid or the solid to a gaseous form. The
drier the air the greater is the cooling effected by
keeping the surface wetted, and the cooling is accelerated
by placing the wet object where there is
a free circulation of air.</p>

<p>A wooden water bucket that has been soaked for
a day or two so that every part of the wood is saturated
with water, will, if kept closed, keep water
all day in the open field practically as cool as when
it left the deep well, and often cooler. Not enough
use is made of cooling by evaporation by those who
have not ice in the summer. Inexpensive and
fairly effective refrigerators may be made, by any
mechanic, of lattice-work sides covered with any
thick fabric and kept moist, which would keep milk,
butter, fruit, vegetables, and cooked meats in good
condition if placed in a hallway with a good circulation
of air, or in any shady place with good ventilation.</p>

<p>Most solids expand with gain in temperature and
therefore possess greater volume in the liquid form
than in the solid, and the temperature of their
melting points rises as they are subjected to increasing
pressure. The law reverses when applied<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60"></a>[60]</span>
to ice, which contracts in melting. To few is it
known that a skater on ice really rides upon water
molecules, for the sharp edge of the skate, when
applied to the ice under the weight of one’s body, is
lubricated by the slight melting of the ice in immediate
contact with the skate, the molecules of water returning
to the form of ice as soon as the skater
passes and the pressure is relieved. The strange
phenomenon may be witnessed by passing a wire
through a block of ice without severing it into two
pieces, by attaching heavy weights to the two ends
of the wire and suspending it across the ice, the ice
slowly melting as the result of the pressure applied
by the underside of the wire and freezing molecules
closing the space on top of the wire. By this process
do we account for the moving of glaciers down
tortuous valleys as though they were liquids.</p>

<p><b>Altitude Measured by Change in Boiling Point
of Water.</b> The boiling point of water at sea level
and ordinary air pressure is 212°. If the pressure
of the atmosphere were increased to about thirty
pounds, instead of about fifteen to the square inch
it would be necessary to raise water to 250° before
boiling would begin. The changes of air pressure
due to the passage of the severe storms of winter
may cause the boiling point of water to vary from<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61"></a>[61]</span>
207° to 215°. This knowledge may be useful in
measuring the heights of mountains, although the
method does not give close results. The decrease
of pressure with altitude lowers the boiling point,
the amount being approximately one degree for
each 555 feet of ascent. The best results may be
secured by having a person at the base of the mountain,
where the elevation above sea level is known,
determine the boiling point at the same time that a
person on the mountain top does. The thermometers
should be read closely to the fraction of a
degree.</p>

<p>With the barometer at its normal height of thirty
inches, air at 60° will instantly rise to the phenomenal
temperature of 175.50 if it be confined and its pressure
doubled, and it will diminish to one half of its
former volume. But if its pressure be diminished
one half, its volume will expand to double its original
size and its temperature will fall from 60° to 2.4°.
From these facts the reader would naturally expect
to find low pressure of the atmosphere accompanying
cold waves and high pressure to be coincident
with warm conditions, which is exactly the reverse
of what actually occurs in the free air of nature.
This apparent contradiction will be made plain in

temperature of -459°</ins> on the Fahrenheit scale
<ins class="corr" id="tn-62a" title="Transcriber’s Note—Original text: 'and 273.1°'">
and -273.1° on the</ins> Centigrade represents what is
called absolute zero. It is supposed to be the temperature
at which there is no motion of the molecules
of matter. Bodies or planets without atmospheres
have temperatures approaching absolute
zero, for there is no protecting envelope to absorb
heat or to prevent the instant radiation into space
of that which impinges upon the body. Our moon
is an illustration, and notwithstanding the fierce
beating upon its surface of the solar energy it remains
incased in the intense cold of space.</p>

<p>The thermometer is the instrument that measures
temperature. It was not until eighty-seven
years after Columbus discovered America that
Galileo discovered the principle of the thermometer.
This first instrument was crude. It consisted of a
glass bulb, containing air, terminating below in a
long glass tube, which dipped into a vessel containing
colored water. When the temperature fell the
contraction of the air in the bulb caused the water
to rise in the tube, and when the temperature rose
the expansion of the air forced the water to a lower
level. Galileo also invented the alcohol thermometer
in 1611, but the determination of the zero
and some fixed point above it, by which to graduate<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63"></a>[63]</span>
the scale, took years to evolve. The modern alcohol
and mercury thermometers consist of a bulb filled
with the liquid, and a tube partly filled, the upper
part being a tolerably complete vacuum, allowing
the liquid freedom of movement up and down the
tube. When a tube is broken one is surprised to see
that the diameter of the bore is less than that of the
smallest fuzzy hair from the back of the hand. The
size of the column of mercury is magnified by the
action of light passing through the glass of the tube.</p>

<p>Temperatures are usually taken in the shade.
The instrument should be free from all bodies that
could conduct heat to it, and it should have free
circulation of air about it.</p>

<p>In a complete meteorological station automatically
recording instruments, too complicated for the
use of the layman, record for each moment of time
the temperature of the air and its pressure, the
periods of sunshine, the duration and the amount
of rainfall, and the direction and velocity of the wind.</p>

<p><b>Observations from Kites.</b> It is strange that the
Chinese, who have been flying kites many thousand
years, should not have made improvements in
the primitive construction of these devices. It
remained for Wendham, in 1866, to perceive the
advantage of superimposing two or more planes,
one above the other, for the purpose of securing a
larger area of sustaining surface. After examining
<a href="#i_fig3">Figure 3</a> almost any one can build an efficient kite.
Heights of two to three thousand feet may be reached
by using cable-laid twine No. 24, but in order to
gain great altitudes pianoforte wire must be used.
Soft pine is the best and most available material.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65"></a>[65]</span>
Spruce is stronger, but more difficult to secure. The
sticks should be straight-grained. The cloth may be
silk or the stronger and finer grades of cotton. It
should be torn, not cut. The ends will then be
true and square with the fiber of the cloth. Kites
are used not only to secure weather observations,
but they have been used to draw sleds in the
Arctic region, and to draw wagons and boats. By
adjusting the points at which the pulling cords are
attached to the boat an ingenious sailor is able to
proceed nearly at right angles to the direction of
the wind.</p>

  <figcaption class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 3.—Standard Weather Bureau Kite.</span></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>When it is known that a box kite having only
sixty square feet of sustaining surface, flying at a
considerable height, may lift a person of ordinary
size, one is impressed with the idea that vessels
of commerce might employ kites of large dimensions
to increase the speed of sailing ships. The
kites would fly in a stratum whose velocity is
not restricted by friction with the surface of the
water.</p>

<p>To launch a kite: run out about one hundred
and fifty feet of the cord or wire while the kite is
held by an assistant, who should give the kite a toss
upward in the direction in which it must go. It
is important that it be cast off directly in line with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66"></a>[66]</span>
the wind. If the wind is light it may be necessary
to run a short distance with a long line out in order to
effect a launching.</p>

<p><b>Voluntary Weather Observers.</b> There are more
than three thousand voluntary or coöperating observers
in the U. S. Weather Bureau. They receive
no compensation other than the publications
of the Bureau. They are required to read their
instruments but once each day, as maximum and
minimum thermometers record the highest and the
lowest temperatures since they were last read and
set. About sunset is the most satisfactory time for
making the readings, since the thermometers will
then show both the extremes for the past twenty-four
hours. As a rule but one voluntary observer
is accepted for a county. They are furnished without
charge with maximum and minimum thermometers,
instrument shelters and rain gauges, but
not with wind vanes, anemometers for recording
direction and velocity of wind, or barometers. But
those who desire to become expert in forecasting the
weather, as all may who study the chapter on forecasting,
should equip themselves with an aneroid
barometer, so that they may note the changes in the
pressure of the air.</p>

<p>An instrument shelter (<a href="#i_fig4">Figure 4</a>) is employed to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68"></a>[68]</span>
screen off the direct and reflected sunshine, and to
keep the thermometers dry. This shelter is a box
with louvered sides, constructed in such form that
there is a free circulation of air through it. It
should be exposed in an open space as far away from
buildings as may be convenient, or on a housetop,
and be as free from shadows as possible. If such
position cannot be secured, then place it on the
north side of a building.</p>

importance to health of maintaining a proper humidity
in living quarters during the winter months
and during all months in the arid and semi-arid
regions of the West is not fully appreciated. Each
habitation should be supplied with one to several
hygrometers (Fig. 6), and frequent readings should
be taken of the dry and the wet bulb thermometers
so as to be familiar with the conditions under which
one is living.</p>

<p>A relative humidity of between sixty-five and
seventy per cent. should be maintained in all living
and sleeping rooms, if one is to escape colds,
catarrh, and possibly pneumonia. Some nervous
disorders are aggravated if not actually caused by
the dryness of the air in steam and other heated
apartments during the time that the windows are
closed in cold weather. The vanity of the female
sex is appealed to with the statement that nothing
is more essential to securing and preserving a good
complexion than the maintaining of a proper humidity
in one’s own room. Efficient and simple and
inexpensive humidifiers are now coming on the
market. They are almost as necessary to the health
of a household as stoves and furnaces. Often a right
degree of moisture can be created by leaving clean
water in the bathtub and in all wash basins and sinks.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73"></a>[73]</span>
One may be surprised on taking humidity observations
to find how quickly it increases in rooms two
or three removed from the bathroom after water is
run into the tub, and especially if the shower spray
is turned on and allowed to operate for a few minutes.</p>

<p>In cold weather we maintain the aridity of the
Sahara Desert in our hot, steam-heated apartments,
with a relative humidity of less than thirty per
cent. Is it any wonder that when we step from this
atmosphere into the cold outside air, with a humidity
of seventy per cent., the violent change is productive
of harm, particularly to the delicate mucous membranes
of the upper air passages, which have been
irritated and their powers of resistance weakened by
the dryness within? The period of pneumonia is the
season of artificial heat in living rooms—or, more
properly speaking, the period of indoor desert aridity.</p>

<p><b>Save Fuel by Moistening Air.</b> If a room at 68°
is not warm enough for any healthy person it is
because the humidity is too low, and water should
be evaporated to bring the moisture up to sixty-five
or seventy per cent. of saturation. Water instead
of coal should be used to make rooms comfortable
when the temperature has reached 68°.
Ten to fifteen per cent. of fuel could be saved in
the heating of places of habitation if the air were<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_74"></a>[74]</span>
properly and healthfully humidified. The reason
for this is that if the air is dry the heat passes through
it and warms it but little. Moisture stops the
radiated heat that would be lost, absorbs it, and
holds it at the place where it is needed. It has
precisely the same effect as a soft wool blanket
wrapped about the body of each person. The dry
air permits such a rapid evaporation from the human
body that one may actually feel colder with a
dry air heated to 75° than in a moist air at 66° or
68°. Water is cheaper than coal, and in this matter
much more healthful.</p>

<p>The cooling effect produced by a draught does
not necessarily arise from the wind being cooler, for
it may be actually warmer, but arises from the
rapid evaporation it causes on the surface of the
skin. Vapor of water forms a blanket about the
earth and prevents it from scorching during the day
and freezing during the night.</p>

<p><b>How to Forecast Weather with Only an Aneroid
Barometer.</b> No one except an expert observer
should use the mercurial barometer. The aneroid
will answer as well for the purpose of forecasting from
a single instrument; it is cheaper and less complicated.
First learn your elevation above sea level;
then add to the observed reading of your instrument<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75"></a>[75]</span>
.10 for each one hundred feet elevation. Note the fall
or rise and the direction of the wind and with the
aid of the table on <a href="#Page_76">page 76</a> highly satisfactory forecasts
may be made by any intelligent person. Skill
will come with practice. Write down your forecasts
each day as you make them and the following
day note in a blank space left for the purpose the
success or failure of your effort. Thus will you
profit by your mistakes.</p>

<p>As a rule winds from the east quadrants and
falling barometer indicate foul weather, and winds
shifting to the west quadrants indicate clearing and
fair weather. The rapidity of the storm’s approach
and its severity are indicated by the rate
and the amount in the fall of the barometer. This
applies to the Mississippi Valley and eastward to
the Atlantic Ocean. Conditions are different in
the Rocky Mountains, on the plateau of the mountains,
and on the eastern Rocky Mountain slope,
where precipitation seldom begins until after the
barometer begins to rise after a fall, and the winds
have shifted to the northwest.</p>

<p>Keep in mind that storms are great atmospheric
eddies drifting from the west, with the winds blowing
cyclonically toward the center; that when your
wind is northeast the center of the storm is southwest
of you; that when it is east the center is west;
when it is south the center is north; when it is
southwest the center is northeast, and when it is
west or northwest the center is east of you.</p>

<p><b>Difference between Weight and Pressure of the
Air.</b> Air at sea level and at 32° temperature weighs
one and one third ounces per cubic foot. A room
twenty by twenty by ten feet contains some 333
pounds of air. The pressure of the air is a quite
different thing. It is the sum of the weights of all
the cubic feet of air that are stacked up, one on top
of the other, clear to the top of the atmosphere.
This is why the higher one goes, the less the pressure
of the air, because there are a less number of
cubic feet above. And then each cubic foot weighs
a slight fraction less than the one just beneath it
because the air has expanded. The room afore-mentioned
sustains a pressure of 5880 on its floor and a
like pressure on its ceiling, and a half of this pressure
on each of the sides of the room. The room does not
collapse because the air exerts a like pressure on the
outside of the room and the two pressures are equal—one
inward and the other outward.</p>

The glass tube on

and the mercury in
the tube falls to <i>n</i>,
at which point it is
sustained by pressure
of the air on
surface of the mercury
in the basin.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p><b>The Principle of the Barometer.</b> In 1643 some
Florentine gardeners found that they could pump
water only thirty-three feet high. This is because<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_78"></a>[78]</span>
the entire volume of air, if it were
compressed to the density of water,
would equal a covering around the
earth of that depth. When the
gardeners first began to work the
plungers in their pump up and down
they did not get water; it was necessary
for them first to pump out all
the air in the pipe leading down to
the water in the well; then the water
rose into the vacuum thus created,
and it rose to a height that just balanced
the weight or pressure of the
whole body of air that rests upon
the earth. Now, if the atmosphere
surrounding the earth could be reduced
to the density of mercury it
would equal a covering only thirty
inches deep; this is why the mercury
normally stands at thirty inches
high in the vertical vacuum tube of
the barometer. (<a href="#i_fig7">Figure 7</a>.) In the
complete barometer a graduated
scale is attached so as to measure
the fluctuations in the height of the
mercury. If one were to ascend in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_79"></a>[79]</span>
a balloon it would be found that the mercury would
steadily fall with increasing altitude, until at eighteen
thousand feet one half of the atmosphere would
be left below and the instrument would read only
fifteen inches instead of thirty. In ascending to the
top of the Washington Monument, 555 feet, the
pressure of the air decreases over one half inch.</p>

<p>The barometer rises and falls with the passage of
storms because wind movement displaces air and
causes it to accumulate at some places and become
deficient at others, but in order to compare barometers
exposed at many different elevations with
the view of determining the geographic position of
storm centers—of cyclones and anti-cyclones—it
is necessary to reduce all barometric readings to
sea level.</p>

<p><b>Weather Records Turn the Scales of Justice.</b> How
trivial the incident that may change the whole
course of a lifetime and lead to peace and happiness
or to discord and sorrow! Likewise the parting of
the clouds and the coming through of the sunshine,
or the moment of the beginning of rainfall, or
the amount of rain that falls within a given
time, or the direction of the wind, or the velocity
of the wind, or the temperature of the air,
or the depth of the snowfall literally thousands of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_80"></a>[80]</span>
times has furnished the evidence in courts of law
that has turned the scales of justice in civil suits
involving large sums of money, and in criminal
cases where a prison sentence or the hangman’s
noose threatened the defendant.</p>

<p>For illustration let us say that a ship breaks from
its mooring, crashes into another ship in the harbor
and sinks it. If the force of the storm is no greater
than has previously occurred in that harbor, the
first ship is liable for the loss of the second ship.
But if the automatically recording instruments of
the Weather Bureau show that at that time the
velocity of the wind was greater than ever had been
known before, then the loss is due to “an act of
God” and the ship that broke her mooring is not
liable for damages to the ship that was sunk, provided
proper provision was made for such velocity
of wind as reasonably might be expected to occur
with the passage of a storm.</p>

<p>To cite a case that actually occurred: A railroad
company was sued for the loss of a million dollars’
worth of lumber that was burned, as alleged, by
sparks from one of its locomotives. Here came in
the wind records of the Government and proved
that at the time of the starting of the fire the wind
was steadily and forcefully blowing in a direction<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_81"></a>[81]</span>
opposite to what would carry the sparks to the
lumber, and the company was protected against an
unjust verdict.</p>

<p>Again heavy rain fell in excess of the capacity of
the sewers of a city to carry away the water, and
private property was damaged by the flood. In
this case the city was compelled to pay for the
damage to property, because the records of the
Weather Bureau showed that previous rainfalls had
been of equal or greater amount in the same period
of time, and the city should have constructed its
sewers of sufficient capacity to carry away such
precipitation as experience showed was liable to
occur.</p>

<p>The writer was once an expert witness in what
then was a famous case. The defendant, a young
and handsome woman previously of unimpeachable
character, was being sued for divorce. Two witnesses
swore that they had seen her come to an
open window, facing south, at seven o’clock in the
morning, in a house in which she should not have
been, stand for several minutes looking into the
garden upon which the window faced, clad only
in her night robe. Unfortunately the woman was
not able to establish a satisfactory alibi for the
morning in question, and she stood facing a terrible<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_82"></a>[82]</span>
calamity with no power to establish her innocence.
Her accusers had given as a reason why she stood so
long at the open window that the morning was
warm and balmy. But, fortunately for the innocent
woman, the weather records came to her defense
when her case seemed hopeless and her life was
about to be blighted with a scandal from which she
never would be able to free herself, and proved that
at the very time when she was supposed to have
been standing in the open window a torrential rain
was falling and a wind of fifty miles per hour was beating
upon the outside of the window panes. The
woman was acquitted and one of the witnesses spent
several hundred balmy mornings behind prison bars.</p>

<p>At another time the writer came into a case where
a robber had shot and killed a citizen who surprised
him in the committing of his crime. The
robber was on trial for murder and his lawyers were
attempting to clear him by the introduction of
evidence to prove that the day was so foggy that
the State’s witnesses had blundered and seized the
wrong man when they chased the murderer around
a corner. The weather expert destroyed the only
evidence that tended to raise a doubt in the mind
of the jury as to the man’s guilt, by testifying that
fog could come to the surface of the earth only when<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_83"></a>[83]</span>
the air was abnormally light and the wind calm or
only gentle; while at the time of the murder the
barometer was unusually high and the wind brisk.
Here again the meteorological records aided in vindicating
the right, and secured the conviction and
execution of a brutal murderer.</p>

<p>A remarkable case was that in which a tramp was
being tried for the murder of a miserly old woman
who was believed to carry a large amount of money
about her person. The tramp came to her door
and asked for food. She took him in and fed him
and soon thereafter he was seen hastily to leave the
house. An hour after he had gone the woman was
found murdered and her clothing rifled. The tramp
was overtaken, found to have a large amount of
money of small denominations in his pockets, indicted,
and placed on trial. The principal witness
for the State was a man who was repairing a frozen
water pipe in a trench by the side of the house opposite
to that by which the tramp entered and left.
He saw the blow struck, ran in fear to his home, and
then informed the police. In explaining how he
came to see the criminal act, he testified that he
climbed out of the trench to get a drink from a bucket
standing near by, and as he raised the bucket his
eye came in line with a window of the house, through<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84"></a>[84]</span>
which he witnessed the murder. The case seemed
clear against the tramp, as other witnesses had seen
him enter and leave the house and positively recognized
him. Just here his lawyer asked the trench
digger how long the water bucket had been sitting
by the side of the trench. The latter said it had
been there from 7 o’clock until 10. Then the
weather records came in to confound the falsifier
and to vindicate innocence, for the automatic tracing
of the pen that records every movement of the
temperature proved that the temperature had not
been above zero any time during the three hours that
the bucket had been exposed and that it contained
a solid chunk of ice if it contained anything. The
trench digger then confessed that he himself was the
murderer. He had seen the tramp enter and leave
and thought it a favorable opportunity to commit
the crime and put the evidence on another.</p>

<h2 class="p2 nobreak" id="CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII<br>
FROST</h2>


<p>There is nothing in the study of the atmosphere
that so intimately concerns the horticulturist and
the gardener as knowledge of the conditions under
which frost forms, and the methods that may be
pursued to gain immunity from its disastrous effects,
or to lessen the loss.</p>

<p>Frost does not necessarily form from air that has
fallen to the freezing point, as many suppose. On
the contrary, the air ten feet or less above the vegetation
may be several degrees above freezing when
there is a heavy and destructive frost upon vegetation.
The fact is that vegetation radiates heat
towards a clear sky faster than does the air and may
fall to the freezing point or below; while the air,
except the molecules actually in contact with the
vegetation, is considerably warmer. Frost is not
frozen dew. The water vapor is precipitated, or<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_86"></a>[86]</span>
rather congealed, upon the vegetation without passing
through the liquid state at all. Frost is spoken
of as light, heavy, and killing. Tomato plants are
killed by only a light touch of frost, while fruit
blossoms will stand several degrees of cold below
freezing. Therefore the tomato grower would consider
as killing a frost that to the fruit grower would
only appear as light.</p>

<p>The radiation of heat from the earth is continuous
both day and night when there are no clouds to
obstruct the passage of the heat rays. The amount
received from the sun during the day is greater than
the loss by radiation from the earth and the temperature
of the air rises. After the setting of the sun
the radiation of the earth goes on but there is no
incoming heat from the sun to offset the loss and the
temperature of the air falls. As previously stated,
the soil and vegetation radiate faster than the air
and the air in immediate contact with the soil is
cooled by conduction to it. Thus over a level plain
on a clear calm night there is found a relatively thin
layer of cold air near the ground, which increases in
temperature up to two hundred or three hundred
feet, or which may be only five or ten feet deep.
Over sloping ground the force of gravity tends to
cause this thin surface layer of cold air to move<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_87"></a>[87]</span>
down the slope and to gather in depressions in somewhat
the same manner as water would move. Such
movement is called Air Drainage. Of course this
air is slowly gaining heat by compression as it passes
to lower levels, but it is hugging closely to the cold
earth and losing by conduction much or all that it
thus gains by compression.</p>

<p>After a study of the contour of the region with respect
to air drainage the writer purchased a considerable<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_88"></a>[88]</span>
tract of land near Rockville, Montgomery
County, Maryland, and planted extensive orchards
thereon, with the result of harvesting nine successful
crops of fruit in a period of ten years after the trees
became large enough to bear. With the composition
and the surface covering of the soil the same, the
low places in a field are always the ones that suffer
most when frost is possible. <a href="#i_fig8">Figure 8</a> shows a
minimum temperature of 25° to have occurred at the
base of a steep hillside when on the higher ground
at an elevation of but fifty feet the lowest temperature
was 44°, and at two hundred and twenty-five
feet up the mountainside the minimum was 52°.</p>

<figure class="figleft illowp100" id="i_fig8" style="max-width: 50em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_p087.jpg" alt="Temperature graph">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 8.</span>—Continuous records of the temperature from 4 <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span> to 9 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span> at
the base and at different heights above the base of a steep hillside, showing
the great differences in temperature that sometimes develop on a
clear, still night. Although the temperature at the base was low enough
to cause considerable damage to fruit, the lowest temperature 225 feet
above on the slope was only 51°. Note that the duration of the lowest
temperature was much shorter on the hillside than at the base.—<cite>Weather
Bureau.</cite></p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>In selecting a location for an orchard it is not so
much a problem of elevation above sea level as elevation
above the surrounding region. The direction
in which the slope faces makes little difference. The
prime consideration is to get sufficient air drainage
to gain the greatest protection against frost without
selecting land with such a steep slope as to furnish
excessive soil drainage and which would be difficult
to cultivate and move about upon in the spraying
of trees and in the picking of fruit. In the
Maryland orchard the elevation was only five
hundred feet above sea level and only about two
hundred feet above the surrounding region, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_89"></a>[89]</span>
the slope was so gradual as almost to be imperceptible
to one passing over it.</p>

<p>After nightfall the air on mountain peaks and on
hills and ridges soon becomes cooler than the air at
the same elevation out over the open valley, due to
contact with the elevated earth, which radiates heat
and cools faster than the air.</p>

<p>Water vapor has a great capacity for heat. It is
the most effective of the various gases present in the
atmosphere in obstructing radiation of heat from the
earth, as well as in absorbing incoming radiation
from the sun. The night temperature, therefore,
falls more slowly when the relative humidity is high
than when it is low, that is to say, when the air is
nearer saturation, or nearer its dew point. Drops
of water that collect on the outside of a pitcher of
ice water on a warm day are formed through the
chilling of the air in contact with the pitcher; they
begin to form as soon as the temperature of the
pitcher reaches the dew point of the air, which
temperature varies in accordance with the amount
of water vapor present in the air at the time. After
sundown the temperature of exposed objects falls,
of some faster than others, depending on their capacities
for radiation. Vegetation radiates freely
and often falls to the dew point of the air, at which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_90"></a>[90]</span>
time dew begins to form on it and continues to be
deposited as long as the temperature remains above
freezing. Now, here carefully note that if the dew
point is above 32° the condensation of water vapor
in the form of dew liberates latent heat, which
usually will be sufficient to check the fall of temperature
and prevent the formation of frost. If the
dew point of the air is 32° or lower frost forms. If
the dew point is very low the temperature may fall
low enough to cause much damage without the
formation of any frost. As an example, if the dew
point be 20° and the temperature falls to 24° much
damage might be done to growing crops and no
frost appear. This phenomenon is called black
frost; it seldom occurs. From the foregoing it
might be assumed that the possibilities of frost might
safely be forecast from an observation to determine
the relative humidity taken early in the evening,
but unfortunately experience has shown that reliance
cannot be placed in such method of forecasting, as
the humid air of early evening may be displaced by
much drier air before the hour of minimum temperature
the next morning.</p>

<p>One of the best locations to gain immunity from
frost at the critical period of plant growth is immediately
to the leeward of a considerable body of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_91"></a>[91]</span>
water. Wind blowing from a large body of water
is always heavily laden with moisture, which decreases
the rate of radiation both day and night,
but especially during the period of cold in the early
morning when frost is liable to occur. Such winds,
largely affected by the temperature of the water
over which they have passed, modify the temperatures
of both day and night.</p>

<p>The all-important condition for the formation of
frost is an atmosphere already cool, with a gentle
northwest wind and a clear sky, which condition,
with more or less coolness, always accompanies the
high barometric areas that follow the low-pressure
areas of warmth, cloudiness, and moisture.</p>

<p>At an expense of two millions of dollars per annum
the Government maintains some two hundred
observation stations of the Weather Bureau, and
twice daily telegraphs observations to all the large
cities of the nation, but unfortunately in many
cases these are not published for the benefit of the
people who could make valuable use of them. The
Bureau’s own deductions from these observations,
in the form of forecasts and warnings, are extremely
valuable, but an even greater service could be rendered
the public by neatly lithographing an evening
weather map and mailing it from all large cities each<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_92"></a>[92]</span>
night, so that every intelligent person whose business
is affected by the weather could, through a study of
the chapter on Forecasting in this book, judge for
himself as to the effect that the coming weather may
have on his particular interests. One could then
watch the movements of the high barometric areas
and the low areas and become weatherwise himself,
and he who studied these charts the most diligently
would have an advantage over less progressive
competitors.</p>

<p>Evaporation goes on at all temperatures, even
below freezing and from solid ice, its rate, of course,
being diminished by low temperatures. At times,
in spring or fall, the temperature of the air over
rivers, when there is little wind, falls so far below
the temperature of the water that the water vapor
rising from the river by evaporation is quickly
condensed in the form of fog, which may cover a part
or all of the low contiguous land, checking radiation
and preventing a further fall in temperature.</p>

<p>In valleys near the ocean, fog sometimes drifts in
from the water when frost is imminent and prevents
its formation. On nights with fog, contrary to the
usual condition, the hillsides are always colder than
the lowlands, unless the fog extends high enough to
cover them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_93"></a>[93]</span></p>

<p>In 1891-1894 the writer, in studying the conditions
under which frost forms on the cranberry bogs of
Wisconsin, was impressed with the fact that the
occurrence of frost on a given field depended as much
on the character of the surface and its covering
as it did on the temperature of the air a few feet
above, one place receiving an injurious frost, another
a light frost, and still another none at all, while each
had the same conditions as to temperature, wind
velocity and direction, and all were at the same elevation,
so that the differences could not be accounted
for by air drainage.</p>

<p>In one case the marsh was cleanly cultivated
and covered with sand, in another there was clean
cultivation but no sand, and in still another case
there was a thick growth of vegetation. As the
result of a long series of observations conducted by
Professor H. J. Cox, working under the directions
of the writer, minimum thermometers were placed
among the vines over newly sanded surfaces in two
marshes, one at Cranmoor and one at Mather,
Wisconsin. The locations selected for this inquiry
represented the best results that could be secured
from sanding, draining, and cultivating. Comparison
was made at each marsh between the readings taken
close to the vines of the clean part of the marsh and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_94"></a>[94]</span>
those taken close to the surface over the unsanded
peat bog. The average lowest night temperature
over the sand for the four months was 5.9° higher
than over the peat at Cranmoor, and 4.2° at Mather.
On one night the minimum over the surface at Cranmoor
was 12° higher than over the peat, while at
Mather a difference of nine degrees was recorded on
another night.</p>

<p>Through cultivation the marsh may be kept free
from weeds, moss, or other rank growth, thus permitting
the sun’s rays to reach the soil and increase
its temperature during the day, while a growth of
thick vegetation screens the soil from the sun’s rays,
and there is consequently less heat in the latter soil
to be given out during the hours of low temperature
at night. Drainage lowers the specific heat of the
soil and decreases the cooling effect of evaporation.
Therefore, under sunshine, the dry soil becomes
warmer than the wet and, whether or not it has
a greater quantity of heat to give off at night, it has a
higher temperature and therefore radiates more freely
to the air above. A covering of sand likewise lowers
the specific heat of the surface and thereby causes it
to gain a higher temperature during the day than
an unsanded surface receiving the same solar rays.
It therefore radiates more rapidly at the critical time<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_95"></a>[95]</span>
when heat is needed to prevent the temperature of
vegetation from falling to the freezing point and
gaining a deposit of frost.</p>

extensive use is made of oil and other fuel-burning

wish further information with regard to this matter<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_96"></a>[96]</span>
should send to the Weather Bureau, Washington,
D. C., for Farmers’ Bulletin No. 1096. At first
thought it would seem that heat so applied would
be blown away or instantly escape upward. But
on frosty nights there is not much wind; if there is,
there is little danger from frost. And then, as
previously stated, on such nights there is what is
called temperature inversion, and the temperature
actually rises with the first few feet of ascent, and
the heated air soon reaches air of its own temperature,
when no further ascent occurs. When the air
forty feet from the ground is ten degrees warmer
than it is around and in contact with vegetation,
as often occurs on frosty nights, the heat from the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_97"></a>[97]</span>
fires is nearly all expended in raising the temperature
of the air within this forty feet. <a href="#i_fig9">Figure 9</a> furnishes

of the foregoing theory.</p>

WIND AND PRESSURE OF THE GLOBE</h2>

<p class="p1 p1b pfs80">CAUSE OF LOCAL WINDS AND OF GENERAL CIRCULATION</p>


<p><b>General Circulation.</b> Differences in temperature,
changing the specific gravity of the air, are the cause
of the general circulation of the atmosphere about
the earth, modified by the rotation of the earth;
likewise the local circulation between land and
water is caused by the different quantities of heat
radiated by the two widely differing forms of matter,
each attaining to a different temperature under
the influence of the same solar radiation; and the
inflow of winds to the cyclone and the outflow from
the anti-cyclone are due to the same forces that cause
the general and the local circulations.</p>

<p>If there were no difference in temperature between
the equator and the poles the atmosphere would soon
adjust itself in accordance with the laws of gravity,
modified by the centrifugal force developed from
the rotation of the earth, and the atmosphere forever<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_99"></a>[99]</span>
would be at rest relative to the earth, moving
with it as if it were a part of the solid sphere throughout
its diurnal rotation on its axis and its annual
movement about the sun. But there is a decided
difference in temperature between the equator and
the poles and between land and water surfaces;
hence a general circulation, modified and distorted
by numerous local movements, which, in turn, may be
modified by the height of hills and mountains and
the direction of their trend.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp100" id="i_fig12" style="max-width: 50em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_p099.jpg" alt="Air cuurents">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 12.</span>—Trade wind circulation and reason for belts of high pressure
at latitudes 30° N. and S. that extend around globe as shown by
<a href="#i_fig13">Figure 13</a>.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Let us trace a current of air through its course as
shown in <a href="#i_fig12">Figure 12</a> and the reason for the blowing of
the trade winds will be apparent, as will the reason
for the location of a belt of high pressure at latitudes
30° north and south encircling the globe. At the
equator there is a belt of calms. Here the air
gently ascends under the intense heat of vertical<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_100"></a>[100]</span>
sunshine. It is humid, for there is much water
surface in the region of the equator, and the air
carries vast quantities of water vapor aloft, later to
be precipitated as torrential rains in the Tropical
Zone, as the air cools by expansion in its ascent.
This air expands or bulges upward and overflows
aloft northward and southward, causing low air
pressure at the equator, because of the quantity
of air moved to other latitudes, which more than
compensates for the amount banked up over the
equator by the centrifugal force of the earth’s
rotation.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp100" id="i_ch1" style="max-width: 50em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_p098a.jpg" alt="Prevailing winds in July">
  <figcaption class="caption"><span class="smcap">Chart 1.—High and Low Centers of Action and Prevailing Winds of the Globe for July</span> (Buchan).</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Since air, passing away from the equator, must
pass successively over parallels of latitude having
less easterly velocity than that with which it started
its journey, it runs ahead of the earth, and, relative
to the surface of the earth, has a direction from the
southwest north of the equator, and from the northwest
south of the equator. Our current was divided
at an altitude probably of six miles above the equator,
one half following the northern and the other
half the southern circuit. It was cooled by elevation
and by radiation outward to space and as a
result gained in weight and gradually descended,
reaching the earth at about latitudes 30° north and
south, and causing an accumulation of air at those<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_101"></a>[101]</span>
latitudes and the belt of high pressure that irregularly
surrounds the earth. In descending in the
belt the air breaks up into a number of anti-cyclonic
systems, sub-permanent highs or Centers of Action,
which have so much to do with initiating the migratory
Highs and Lows that create the weather of
the earth, as will be fully explained in the <a href="#CHAPTER_IX">Chapter
on Weather Forecasting</a>. The intensity of these centers
of action is modified and their geographic positions
shifted with change of season. (See <a href="#i_ch1">Charts 1</a> and <a href="#i_ch2">2.</a>)</p>

</figure>

<p><b>Trade Winds.</b> But to return to the current that
we left as it divided above the equator (<a href="#i_fig12">Figure 12</a>)
and descended on an inclined plane to latitudes 30°
north and south. It is cooler and dryer and heavier
than when it started to ascend and it has lost the
thousand miles per hour and more easterly velocity
that it had at the equator and now only has the
velocity that belongs to latitude 30°; therefore as
it moves toward the equator from either side it lags
behind latitudes whose easterly velocity is greater,
and it takes up a direction partly toward the west,
which, relative to the earth, makes it a northeast
wind in the Northern Hemisphere and a southeast
wind in the Southern Hemisphere. And thus is
established a circulation the lower part of which is
known as the “trade winds.” (<a href="#i_fig13">Figure 13</a>.)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_102"></a>[102]</span></p>

<p>Navigators profit largely by availing themselves
of the west winds in the middle latitudes and of the
east winds in the tropics. To the daring and persistence
of Columbus, and the force and constancy
of the trade winds which blew him westward, we
owe the discovery of America.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp75" id="i_fig13" style="max-width: 50em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_p102.jpg" alt="Prevailing winds">
  <figcaption class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 13.</span>—Average surface winds and pressure of the globe.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p><b>Winds of Middle Latitudes.</b> Now study <a href="#i_fig12">Figure
12</a> and associate the information it conveys with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_103"></a>[103]</span>
that of <a href="#i_fig13">Figure 13</a>, and observe that from the two
belts of high pressure the air is pushed outward on
both sides. In each case it starts as a true north or
south wind, but, due to the rotation of the earth,
is always and everywhere deflected to the right in the
Northern Hemisphere and to the left in the Southern
Hemisphere, and this deflection increases until what
started as a poleward wind in the middle latitudes
soon becomes almost a due west wind. In this region
of west winds cyclonic storms are more frequent than
in any other part of the globe. Now get clear in the
mind the fact that no matter what may be the direction
of the wind inside a cyclonic or anti-cyclonic
whirl (often one thousand miles in diameter), the whirl
is carried toward the east by the general drift from the
west of the winds between latitudes 30° and 60°, and
toward the west in the region of the trade winds.</p>

<p><b>Low Barometer at the Poles.</b> Even though the
air is contracted and rendered denser by the great
cold of the Arctic regions, the pressure remains low
because of the quantity of air driven equatorward by
the centrifugal force both of the earth and of the
winds themselves as they rim ahead of the earth
and encircle the globe in the middle latitudes.</p>

<p><b>Data too Meager to Show Full Circulation Aloft
of the Atmosphere of the Globe.</b> Many charts<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_104"></a>[104]</span>
have been published in the attempt to show how the
atmosphere circulates below and aloft through the
whole world. They only have speculative value,
as our knowledge is too limited to permit us to unravel
the complexities of all the upper movements.</p>

<p><b>Rain Winds of the Tropics.</b> The trade winds,
mostly moving over water surfaces, are laden with
moisture, but, gaining temperature as they move
towards the equator, their capacity to hold water
vapor steadily increases, and therefore they do not
become rain winds unless forced to ascend by the
interposition of mountains, or until cooled by
ascension at the equator. In no part of the world
does the air rise so steadily and in such great volume
as in the equatorial belt of calms and low pressure.
Hence this is the region of greatest rainfall. During
the two rainy seasons, spring and fall, the day
opens clear; near midday the clouds gather and
rain falls early in the afternoon; after which it
quickly clears. This is so regular a program that
one lays his plans accordingly. There is almost no
rain in December and January; this is because the
belt of calms and the inflowing trade winds move
northward and southward with the migrations of
the sun, and in December and January, the sun being
far south, the northern trades, with their rainless<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_105"></a>[105]</span>
winds, cover the equator and the region formerly
occupied by the belt of calms. In midsummer the
sun is far north and then the southern trades move
up and give dryness to the equator. In the northern
trades, of the moderate amount of rain that falls,
the greater quantity falls in summer; in the southern
trades the order is reversed.</p>

<p><b>Rain of the High-Pressure Belts and of the Regions
of West Winds.</b> In the high-pressure belts the
air is settling down and gaining heat by compression
and there is not much horizontal movement. These
are, therefore, regions of but little rainfall, and all
the great deserts occur in or near them. The belts
of west winds are the regions of most frequent
cyclonic activities. Here the rainfall is quite equally
distributed throughout the year and is the result of the
mixing of the air by storms and its cooling by expansion
as it is carried upward in the migrating whirl.</p>

<p><b>Circulation between Continents and Oceans.</b> In
<a href="#CHAPTER_X">Chapter X</a>, under the sub-caption “Influence of
Continents and Oceans on Climate”, the circulation
between them is well explained. In general the
movement is from the continent to the oceans in
winter, with the air flowing inward aloft to settle
down and take the place of that which passes out to
sea. In summer the directions are reversed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_106"></a>[106]</span></p>

<p><b>Daily Variation in Coastal Winds.</b> In summer,
when there are no forceful storm winds blowing
steadily from one direction for several hours at a
time, there will daily spring up gentle to fresh winds
from the surface of oceans and large lakes to the land,
because of the influence of the sun’s rays in heating
the land to a higher temperature than it does the
water. These winds will not appear on cloudy days
and they will extend inland but a few miles.</p>

<p><b>Monsoon Winds.</b> During winter the vast continent
of Eurasia (Europe and Asia) cools to such
an extremely low temperature as to develop a High,
or center of action, of great energy and extent, which
drives a steady dry monsoon into the Indian Ocean
and China Sea. Unlike the trade winds, these winds
reverse their direction in the summer; then the
intense heat of the continent to the north develops
an extensive Low, which draws the ocean winds inland
and extends its influence so far south as to
attract the southeast trade winds of the Southern
Hemisphere and, turning them so that they flow
from the southwest, continue them far into the
interior of Asia. Since the summer monsoon blows
from a tropical sea it comes heavily laden with
water vapor and as it rises over the mountains of
the great Himalayan system copious rains are<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_107"></a>[107]</span>
precipitated. In Australia, Africa, South America,
and some parts of the North American continent
monsoon influence in various degrees is felt, but in
no place is the monsoon so important as in the countries
bordering the Indian Ocean. (<a href="#i_ch15">Charts 15</a> and <a href="#i_ch16">16</a>.)</p>

<p><b>Föhn Winds.</b> This is a hot wind that sometimes
blows down a mountain side in the Alps. In the
Rocky Mountains it is called the Chinook Wind. It
is caused by moisture-laden air being drawn over a
high mountain so quickly that the heat liberated
in condensation does not have time to escape by
radiation. The air cools by expansion as it ascends
on the west side of the mountain, but it gains this
all back by compression as it descends, and it has
added to its temperature much of the heat of condensation.
It is dry and greedily evaporates snow
from the ground in winter, clearing off a deep covering
within a few hours.</p>

a non-rotating earth.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p><b>How Winds Are Deflected by Earth’s Rotation.</b>
Every free-moving thing, whether wind or projectile,
is deflected to the right of its initial direction by the
rotation of the earth in the Northern Hemisphere
and to the left in the Southern Hemisphere, unless
the object be moving exactly along the line of the
equator. Winds moving inward to a Low are
therefore so deflected as to cause the cyclone to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_108"></a>[108]</span>
gyrate in a direction contrary to the movements of
the hands of a watch. In an anti-cyclone the movement
is with
the watch. In
the Southern
Hemisphere
these wind directions
are reversed.</p>

<p><a href="#i_fig14">Figure 14</a>
gives an illustration
of what
would be the
movement of
air inward to
a cyclone on a non-rotating earth. The winds
would blow along radial lines for a time, but,
converging together as they began to ascend, they
doubtless would soon set up a gyration about the
center. On a non-rotating earth this gyration would
be clockwise as often as it would be anti-clockwise,
but on a rotating earth the gyration can be in but
one direction. (<a href="#i_fig15">Figure 15</a>.) Even tornadoes, whose
diameters of rotation are never but a few hundred
feet, obey this law. In little dust whirls, in which the
movements of air may be comprehended from the motion<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_109"></a>[109]</span>
of the trash that is whirled about and which are
tornadoes in miniature, the direction of gyration may
be either way.
They are too
small for the
deflecting force
to be appreciable,
and it
may be that
the tornado is
forced to take its
direction of
gyration from
the cyclone in
whose southeast
quarter it has its origin.</p>

<p><b>How Wind Velocity Increases with Altitude.</b>
<a href="#i_fig16">Figure 16</a> shows how the velocity of the wind increases
with elevation in the free air up to five
thousand meters (about three miles). The average
for the year, for the summer and for the winter, is
given. It increases most rapidly up to six hundred
meters in summer and up to eight hundred meters in
winter. From these two heights there is a steady
and pronounced slowing down of the wind up to
one thousand meters; after which it increases up to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_110"></a>[110]</span>
five thousand meters, and how far beyond we know
not. In winter there is a singular acceleration of
velocity in the stratum between two thousand and
twenty-five hundred meters and then no increase for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_111"></a>[111]</span>
the next five hundred meters; after which there is
a uniform and steady gain up to five thousand meters.
Starting at two hundred and seventy meters, the
average velocity for the year is 3½ meters per second,
or about 7¼ miles per hour. At five thousand meters
altitude the average for the year is 11¼ meters per
second, or about 27 miles per hour.</p>

HOW TO FORECAST FROM THE DAILY WEATHER MAP</h2>

<p class="p1 p1b pfs80">IT IS NOT DIFFICULT TO BECOME WEATHERWISE AND
THEREBY TO GAIN ADVANTAGES IN HEALTH, HAPPINESS, AND BUSINESS</p>


<p>The person who will take the time to learn to interpret
the daily weather map has a decided advantage
over those who are less progressive. The
maps may be secured by applying to any Weather
Bureau station. Many members of commercial
associations, having the advantage of seeing the large
glass weather map that is made each morning by an
observer of the Weather Bureau and displayed on the
floor of the association, have become expert weather
forecasters. The value of the principal crops of
the country is largely influenced by the weather,
as are the prices of transportation and industrial
stock; and there is hardly a business that directly or
indirectly is not influenced by the prospects of coming
weather.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_113"></a>[113]</span></p>

<p>Vessel masters, long accustomed to forecast the
near approach of storms from the action of their
“glass” (barometer), now have learned that the
daily weather map shows them at a glance the
height of not one but of many barometers scattered
over a wide area and read at the same moment of
time. They see that the direction and the force
of the wind are the results of differences in air pressure;
that the air flows from a region where the
air pressure is great, that is to say, where the barometers
are high, towards a region where the pressure
is less, or where the barometers are low; and
that the velocity of the wind will be in proportion
to the difference in the pressure of the air. Coast-wise
and lake shipping are therefore not only affected
by the forecasts made by the Weather Bureau but
by the forecast made by the masters themselves
when they can get access to the daily weather map.
Their own lives and the lives and property of others
are in their keeping. But the great mass of intelligent
people have no idea of the methods employed
in the making of the weather map and of the many
and widely diversified uses to which a study of its
data would lead.</p>

<p>One first must learn of the simple manner in which
the map is constructed; then, by a comparison of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_114"></a>[114]</span>
the map each day with the preceding chart, he soon
will be able to detect the beginning of storms, trace
them through their various migrations as they cross
the continent and finally pass out to sea, bidding
them bon voyage as they go in quest of a more
eastern continent on which to bestow their blessings
of rain and active, purified air; or, as it often may
happen, shuddering for the fate of the mariner who is
caught in their fierce vortical whirls, and for the land
areas that may be laid waste by their gyrating force.</p>

<p><b>How the Weather Map Is Made.</b> At 8 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span>
to-day Washington time, which, by the way, is
about seven o’clock at Chicago, six at Denver, and
five at San Francisco, the observers at some two
hundred stations in the United States and contiguous
territory were taking their observations and from
carefully standardized instruments noting the conditions
of the atmosphere. By 8:20 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span> the barometers
at each station have been reduced to sea
level, that is to say, they have been made to read
what they would if they were located at the level
of the ocean. Thus differences in air pressure that
are due to differences in elevation are eliminated,
so that they may not obscure those due to storm
conditions. Then, for purposes of brevity and accuracy,
the observations are reduced to cipher form,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_115"></a>[115]</span>
and each filed at the local telegraph office. During
the next thirty or forty minutes the observations,
with the right of way over all lines, are speeding to
their destinations, each station contributing its own
report, and receiving in return such observations
from other stations as it may require. The observations
from all stations are received at such
important centers as Washington, New York,
Chicago, and other large cities having Weather
Bureau stations, and from these centers daily weather
maps are printed and issued at 11 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span> each day.</p>

<p>Now turn to <a href="#i_ch3">Chart 3</a>. Heavy black lines (isobars,
meaning equal pressure) are drawn through places
having the same barometric reading. The readings
are omitted from the printed Chart. By drawing
lines for each difference of one tenth of an inch,
the high and the low-pressure areas (called Highs
and Lows) are soon inclosed in their proper circles.
These lines run in oval or circular form, indicating
that storms operate in the form of great atmospheric
eddies; that there are central places of attraction
<em>towards</em> which the air is drawn if the disturbance be
a low-pressure area, with its usual accompaniments
of warm, moist, and often rainy weather, and <em>from</em>
which the air is driven if it be a high-pressure area,
with cool, settled weather.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_116"></a>[116]</span></p>

<p>The word “High” is written inside the isobar
marked 30.6, located in southern Oregon, and the
same word is written inside the isobar marked 30.4,
located on the South Atlantic coast, and also inside
the isobar 30.04, which traverses Nova Scotia. These
are the regions of great air pressure. The word
“Low” is written at the center of the area inclosed
by the isobar 29.6, which is situated in the State of
Iowa. The latter is the region of least pressure.
Sometimes there are several such regions shown on
the weather map.</p>

<p><b>Why the Wind Blows.</b> Under the pull of gravity
the atmosphere presses downward and outward,
thus causing it to flow from the several regions of
great pressure towards regions of less pressure.
Observe the arrows, which fly with the wind, and it
will be seen how generally this law is obeyed. The
velocity with which the wind moves from the High
toward the Low depends on differences in air pressure,
modified in the lower stratum by the friction offered
in passing over surfaces of varying degrees of roughness,
the speed being greater over a water surface with
the same difference in air pressure than over a level
unwooded prairie, and greater over the open prairie
than over an irregular wooded area. To illustrate:</p>

<p>If the barometer were 30.5 at Bismark, Dakota,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_117"></a>[117]</span>
and 29.5 at Chicago, it would press upon the earth
with a force of about seventy pounds greater per
square foot at the first place than at the second.
This difference in pressure would cause the air to
flow from Bismark towards Chicago so rapidly that
after allowing for the resistance due to friction on
the earth there would remain a velocity of some
fifty miles per hour, and Lake Michigan would
experience a severe “Northwester”; and if the
wind continued from the same direction for twenty-four
hours a mighty sea would beat upon the eastern
shore of the lake, and mariners and marine property
would be at the mercy of a destructive tempest
unless the Weather Bureau forecaster were alert
and gave warning as soon as he saw such a juxtaposition
of pressure distribution in the process of formation.</p>

<p>We will give careful attention to this chart,
for when its details are understood, others will be
easily read.</p>

<p>The chart shows a winter storm central in Iowa
on December 15, 1893. The word “Low” marks
the storm center. It is the one place in all the
United States where the barometer reading is the
lowest. The heavy black lines, oval and nearly
concentric, about the Low, show the gradation of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_118"></a>[118]</span>
air pressure as it increases quite uniformly in all
directions from the center of the storm outward.</p>

<p>The arrows fly with the wind, and, as will be seen,
almost without exception are moving towards the
Low, or storm center, clearly demonstrating the effect
of gravity in causing the air to flow from the several
regions marked “High”, where the air is abnormally
heavy, toward the Low, where the air is lighter. As
the velocity of water flowing down an inclined plane
depends both upon the slope of the plane and the
roughness of its surface, so the velocity of the wind,
as it flows along the surface of the earth towards the
storm center, depends on the amount of the depression
of the barometer at the center and the resistance
offered by surfaces of varying degrees of roughness.</p>

<p><b>Storms and Cold Waves Simply Great Eddies in
the Atmosphere.</b> Now picture in your mind that
all the air inside the 30.2 isobar, as it flows inward,
is rotating about the Low in a direction contrary
to the movements of the hands of a watch, and you
have a fair conception of an immense atmospheric
eddy. Have you ever watched the placid waters of
a deep-flowing brook and observed that where the
waters encountered a projecting rock little eddies
formed and went spinning down the stream? Well,
our storms are somewhat similar eddies in the atmosphere,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_119"></a>[119]</span>
more or less perfect, that are carried along by
the general easterly movement of the atmosphere
in the middle latitudes of both hemispheres. But
they are not deep eddies; the Low marks the center
of an atmospheric circulation of vast horizontal
extent as compared with its thickness or extension
in a vertical direction. Thus a storm area extends
from Washington, D. C., to Denver, Colorado, and
yet extends upward only about six miles. The
whole disk of whirling air, six miles thick and two
thousand miles in diameter, is called a cyclone, or
low-pressure area. It is important that a proper
understanding be had of this fundamental idea,
since the weather experienced from day to day
depends almost wholly upon the movement of these
migrating cyclones, or areas of low pressure, and
the anti-cyclones, or areas of high pressure.</p>

<p>The temperature readings are omitted from each
station, but the average temperature of each quadrant
of the Low is shown by the large black figures.
The greatest difference in temperature is seen to be
between the southeast and the northwest sections.
This is due in part to the fact that in the southeast
quadrant the air is drawn northward from warmer
latitudes, and in the northwest quadrant it is drawn
southward from colder latitudes, and to the further<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_120"></a>[120]</span>
fact that winds blowing into the west side of a Low
have a downward component of motion, and those
blowing in on the front, or east side, have an upward
component.</p>

<p>One should gain a clear idea of the difference between
the movements of the air in the cyclone and
the movement of the cyclone itself, or its translation
from place to place; how the wind must blow into
the front of the storm in a direction partly or wholly
contrary to the movement of the storm itself, and
into the rear of the storm as it passes away; how
the wind increases in velocity as it spirally gyrates
about the center and approaches nearer and nearer
the region where it must ascend; how the higher
layers of air move spirally away from the center and
thus cause an accumulation of air about and over
the outer periphery of the Low, which in turn presses
downward and impels the surface air inward. This
whole complex system of motion moves eastward.
Think of the sun drifting in space, while at the same
time each of the planets maintains its respective
orbit, and it will help one to visualize the phenomena
of a migrating cyclone or anti-cyclone.</p>

<p><a href="#i_ch4">Chart 4</a>, constructed from observations taken

central over the southern point of Lake Michigan.
The shaded portion of the chart shows that rain
has fallen during the past twelve hours throughout
nearly the entire region covered by the cyclone.
This was due to the mixing of the air as the storm
progressed, to the cooling by expansion as the air
ascended, to the more rapid rotation about the
storm center, because of the further lowering of the
barometer at the center of the disturbance since the
preceding chart was made, and especially to the
more humid air encountered as the storm moved
eastward and came nearer to the supply of moist
winds,—the Atlantic Ocean.</p>

<p>On <a href="#i_ch5">Chart 5</a> a line of arrows extends from the
storm center westward to Wyoming, where the
storm originated. A small cross inclosed by a circle
marks its western extremity. Another cross located
near Cheyenne shows where the storm center was
located twelve hours after its origin. A third cross
gives it location near Des Moines twenty-four hours
after it started eastward. It was here that we began
the study of this storm on <a href="#i_ch3">Chart 3</a>. A cross near
Chicago indicates the distance traveled by the
center during the third twelve hours, and <a href="#i_ch5">Chart 5</a>
shows its progress during the fourth twelve-hour
period. When the storm was central at Cheyenne<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_122"></a>[122]</span>
the danger warnings for mariners were displayed at
all ports of the Great Lakes, as the forecaster knew
that in accordance with general laws the storm must
move toward the east. When it was centered at
Chicago, danger warnings were displayed on the
Atlantic coast from North Carolina to Maine, as
it was known that long before the storm reached the
ocean the in-rush of wind toward the storm center
would cause a dangerous on-shore gale and the breaking
of heavy seas on the shore line. All craft that
could be reached with the danger signals made safe
in port, except the great ocean liners, which are of
such strength as to safely withstand almost any
storm. A special set of observations ordered by
the Washington office of the Weather Bureau from
its stations in the region of the storm, and well in
advance of it, kept the chief forecaster informed as
to the progress of the cyclone, and before the storm
center reached the coast the danger signals communicated
to mariners the fact that the winds would
soon shift to northwest as the center of the disturbance
passed out to sea.</p>

<p>The reader’s attention will now be directed to
the red lines on <a href="#i_ch5">Chart 5</a>; they pass through places
having the same temperature, but for simplicity the
readings of temperature, whereby these lines were<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_123"></a>[123]</span>
located, are omitted from the printed chart. Observe
the line marked 40°; it passes across southern
New England to western New York, but when it
reaches the center of the storm it encounters the
cold northwest winds blowing into the storm on its
west side and is forced southward to Texas.</p>

<p><a href="#i_ch3">Charts 3</a>, <a href="#i_ch4">4</a>, and <a href="#i_ch5">5</a> give a graphic history of one
severe winter storm. In summer such general
storms do not often occur. They are frequent in
spring and fall, but of higher temperature and less
severity than in winter. In summer Lows drift
sluggishly across the continent; the barometer at
the center of the cyclone is usually not more than
two to four tenths of an inch below the pressure of
the Highs, and the rain, instead of falling in a broad
sheet, as shown by the shading of charts 4 and 5,
falls in numerous sporadic outbursts, each of which
is but a few square miles in area, their combined
surfaces usually covering only a part of the region
over which passes the Low.</p>

<p><b>Cold Waves and the Speed of Storm Movement.</b>
Highs and Lows drift across the continent from the
west towards the east at the average rate of about
six hundred miles per day, or about thirty-seven
miles per hour in winter and twenty-two miles in
summer, the first at about the rate of an express<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_124"></a>[124]</span>
train, and the second approximating the speed of a
freight. The Highs are attended by dry, cool, and
settled weather. By a vortical action at their
centers they draw down the cold air from great
altitudes above the clouds. In winter, when vortical
action is vigorous, they may reach upward to
an altitude of seven miles. Air starting downward
from this region has a temperature of some 70°
below zero. We know this from the records secured
by sending aloft free balloons carrying automatic
thermometers. (<a href="#CHAPTER_II">Chapters II</a> and <a href="#CHAPTER_III">III</a>.) This
air heats by compression because in its downward
movement it is continually leaving more and more
air above it to exercise pressure upon it. It gains
about twenty degrees with each mile of descent, and
if there were no other factors to the problem it
would be hot air when it reached the surface of the
earth instead of cold air. But early in its descent
it gains such heat as to melt and evaporate the ice
spiculæ floating at the height of the fleecy cirrus
clouds; then it evaporates and clears away the moist
clouds lower down and finally creates such <em>diathermancy</em>
(the capacity to transmit heat without absorption;
see <a href="#CHAPTER_V">Chapter V</a>) that the heat lost by radiation
to a clear sky causes what we call a “cold wave”,
and this notwithstanding the heat of compression.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_125"></a>[125]</span></p>

<p>The forecaster first observes a cold wave in the
northern Rocky Mountain region, in the form of an
intense High. It will travel southeastward to the
center of the continent, and often to the Gulf if it
is preceded by an active Low that is located on a
low latitude, as the latter will draw southward the
frosty air of the High; after that the course of the
storm will be more nearly eastward. Now it is of rare
occurrence that a cold wave gains entrance to any considerable
area of our territory without warning, but
in the early days of the Weather Bureau they too
often reach Iowa, or States farther east, without any
notice whatever. It was then discovered that a
certain type of weather map preceded such failures
of the forecaster. One who is interested in gaining
early knowledge of the approach of a cold wave to
the United States should watch not only for the
appearance of abnormally high barometer readings,
from the stations of the Canadian Northwest, or
from Montana and North Dakota, but especially
for a crescent-shaped Low, with one horn of the
crescent touching Lake Superior and the other extending
into the middle Rocky Mountain region,
at about Colorado. This Low will appear to be an
innocent affair; there may be a small secondary
Low in each end of the crescent, and no High of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_126"></a>[126]</span>
any importance in the northwest, for which one
ordinarily would look in anticipating a cold wave.
But when this crescent-shaped Low appears on the
morning weather map, a High of marked intensity
invariably will develop with great suddenness over
Montana and North Dakota and bring a cold wave
to the Middle Mississippi Valley before the next
morning, if the time of year be winter.</p>

<p>Do not forget that the Low is as important as
the High in causing a cold wave, for the High that
brings the cold air must follow in the track of the
Low and will be attracted by the latter in proportion
to its lowness, as indicated by the isobar inclosing
the center of the Low. A cold wave will
reach the Gulf only if the preceding Low originate
in Texas; it will be confined to the Ohio Valley as
the limit of its southern influence if the preceding Low
originate in Colorado; and it will only skirt the
northern border of the United States and the Lake
region if the Low begin in Montana.</p>

<p>More and more is man applying science to commerce
and industry. When the weather map,
which was unknown but little more than half a
century ago, indicates the formation of a heavy
body of cold air in the extreme northwest, the chief
official forecaster at Washington is on the alert;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_127"></a>[127]</span>
he orders special observations every few hours from
the Weather Bureau stations directly within and
well in advance of the cold area, and as soon as he
becomes satisfied that a cold wave is on its way,
the previously arranged system of disseminating
warnings is brought into action, and by telegraph,
telephone, flags, whistles, bulletins, and other agencies,
the people in every city, town and hamlet,
and many in the stock and farming regions, are
notified of the advancing cold twelve to twenty-four
hours before it reaches them.</p>

</figure>

<p><a href="#i_ch9">Chart 9</a> shows the number of times that a cold
wave occurred at each station of the Weather Bureau
for a period of ten years. The number is greater
for northern New England than for the Red River<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_129"></a>[129]</span>
of the North Valley, because practically all the cold
waves that cross Minnesota reach New England;
and the latter also receives fierce boreal visitors that
come to it from the Hudson Bay region lying directly
northeast, which do not visit any portion of
Minnesota or the region farther west. During the
period not a single technical cold wave occurred at
the coast stations of California, Oregon, or Washington,
while Red Bluff and Sacramento were the only
two places in California west of the Sierras, and
Roseburg, Oregon, the only station west of the
Cascade Range that had any, the numbers being
one, two, and five respectively. In the Florida
peninsula south of Jacksonville, Tampa had two,
while none occurred at Miami. Sometimes the
temperature falls lower than that required for a
cold wave, but not within the period of twenty-four
hours required by the regulations. A notable case
in point is the severe cold wave in California in
January, 1913, the lowest temperature ever observed
being recorded at San Diego on the 7th, when the
minimum fell to 25°.</p>

<p><b>Cold Waves Tempered by Great Lakes.</b> The
severity of cold waves is markedly modified by the
Great Lakes, especially in the fall and the first part
of winter, before much of the water surface is covered<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_130"></a>[130]</span>
with ice and snow. Not only is the number of cold
waves much less at stations of the Lakes than at
near-by places in the interior, but there is a marked
variation in the number that occur at the Lake
stations, depending upon which side of the lake and
how close to the water the station is located. The
most striking differences are noted in the Lake
Michigan region, the number on the west shore being
five or six times as great as on the east side.
Milwaukee shows a count of forty-seven as compared
with nine at Grand Haven. This lake influence
affects the entire Lower Michigan peninsula,
but it is not so great in the interior and eastern
sections as along the west shore, Grand Haven’s
nine standing out against fourteen, fifteen, and
twenty-three for Grand Rapids, Detroit, and Port
Huron. A similar condition is noted in New York
State; Buffalo, Rochester, and Oswego, near the lake
shore, had twenty, twenty-seven, and twenty-nine
cold waves respectively, while the interior stations
of Ithaca, Binghamton, and Syracuse had thirty-eight,
forty-five, and fifty-two.</p>

<p><b>Cold Waves Tempered by the Heat of Cities.</b>
Another reason for the lack of uniformity in the recorded
number of cold waves in the various sections
of the country is the difference between city and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_131"></a>[131]</span>
suburban temperatures. Stations located in small
villages or in the open land will show a greater
number of recorded cold waves than those located
in large cities, where the heat stored up by pavements
and brick buildings during sunshine each
day, and where the heat from <ins class="corr" id="tn-131" title="Transcriber’s Note—Original text: 'thousand of chimneys'">
thousands of chimneys</ins>,
and maybe millions of human beings, holds the minimum
temperature of night much above that of the
free air in the open country. Charles City, where
the instruments have open country exposure had
sixty-five cold waves, which far exceeds the number
recorded at any other station in Iowa.</p>

<p>No matter how severe may be the cold wave
that appears in the northwest, it will not extend
over Wyoming, Colorado, Utah, and any region south
of them, unless the center of the High extends well
over the Rocky Mountain Divide. Otherwise it
will come down the east slope of the mountains
and the cold will not cross them.</p>

<p>In the Lows the conditions of the air and its movements
are exactly the reverse of what they are in the
Highs; the air is warmer and moister, it is drawn
spirally inward from all directions instead of being
forced outward as in the High, and it ascends as it
approaches the center of depression, sometimes
causing rain or snow as it cools by expansion during<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_132"></a>[132]</span>
its ascent. While the air cools with ascent in the
Low at the same rate that it warms with descent in
the High, the earth experiences a general warming
effect with the passage of the Lows, because the air
falls but little in temperature as it rises before it
reaches its dew point, and then there is a liberation
of the latent heat of condensation (see <a href="#CHAPTER_V">Chapter V</a>);
and what is more important, there is formed a covering
of clouds that checks or wholly stops radiation
outward from the lower air. However there are
times when the passage of Lows produces a cooling
effect. This is when abnormally hot weather
has prevailed for some days; then the air may be
mixed, washed, and cooled by thunder-showers.</p>

</figure>

<p>Highs and Lows alternately drift across the continent
in periods of about three days each. They
are a part of the divine economy that provides for
the seedtime and the harvest, for, as previously
stated, the Lows draw the warm, vapor-bearing
currents inland from the Gulf and the ocean and
cause them to deposit their moisture far to the north
and west. Four sevenths of all our storms come from
the middle or the north plateau regions of the Rocky
Mountains, or at least enter our field of observation
from those regions, and pass from this arid or sub-arid
section of the continent easterly over the Lakes<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_133"></a>[133]</span>
and New England, producing but little rainfall.
The greater part of the remaining three sevenths
are first observed in the arid regions of our southwestern
States; they always move northeastward
and can be depended on to give bountiful rainfall so
soon as or a little before they reach the Mississippi
River. Some of them cross the Atlantic and affect
the continent of Europe. <a href="#i_ch10">Charts 10</a> and <a href="#i_ch11">11</a> show
the courses of storms in this country, and where
they originate, or are first brought under the survey
of our system of observation.</p>

<p><b>West Indian Hurricanes.</b> A few of the most
severe storms that touch any portion of our continent
originate in the West Indies and travel in a
northwesterly direction until they touch our Gulf
or South Atlantic coast, when, passing from the influence
of the northeast trade winds which carried
them westward, they recurve and pass along our
eastern coast, usually with their centers offshore and
following the Gulf Stream. These violent atmospheric
convulsions are usually detected in the process
of formation through the effectiveness of the
storm-warning service established by the writer
during the Spanish-American War, under the direction
of the President, for the purpose of giving
warning to our fleet before the coming of a hurricane.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_134"></a>[134]</span>
The President realized the great part played by
storms in many of the naval battles of the past, and
it may be surmised that he was more afraid of a
West Indian hurricane than he was of the Spanish
Navy. But Cervera was beaten and the blockade
was raised before the hurricanes of 1898 began.</p>

<p><b>Galveston Hurricane.</b> The new Weather Service,
with a cordon of stations down the Windward Islands
and along the north coast of South America,
surrounding our fleet, and inaugurated as a war
measure, so demonstrated its value in locating and
giving warning of the coming of a hurricane soon after
the end of the war that Congress continued it as a
permanent instrument of peace; and when the destructive
Galveston Hurricane occurred in 1900 it
detected the storm at its inception and so fully
advised shipping of the storm’s movements that
not a vessel was lost as the storm roared and gyrated
across the Gulf of Mexico and crashed upon the
Texas coast, destroying a large part of the city
and drowning six thousand people.</p>

<p>The hurricane is simply a rapidly gyrating cyclone;
it usually is only one to three hundred miles in diameter.
The storm that destroyed Galveston moved
across the Caribbean Sea at the rate of only about
eight to ten miles an hour. It increased its rate as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_135"></a>[135]</span>
it moved northward, crossing the Gulf at about
fifteen miles per hour. The speed of translation
was so slow and the velocity of gyration so rapid
that immense swells were propagated outward from
the center of the storm; they reached the Texas
coast some sixteen hours before the storm itself
reached Galveston. As it moved northward to
Iowa its velocity of translation increased and its
rate of gyration decreased, so that it crossed the
Lakes with both movements at about sixty miles
per hour. At Galveston the anemometer blew to
pieces after recording one hundred and thirty miles
per hour.</p>

<p><b>Danger to Atlantic Coast Summer Resorts.</b> The
writer frequently has been asked as to the possibilities
of a populous Atlantic coast resort being submerged
by the waters driven inshore by a hurricane,
or being lifted up in the center of the storm as the
result of decreased air pressure inside the cyclonic
whirl. The answer is that such a catastrophe is
possible to any Atlantic coast city (more especially
those south of Norfolk) that is not protected by a
heavy breakwater of ten to twenty feet above sea
level, and whose building foundations and walls are
not of brick or concrete for at least ten feet above
the water level. It would be necessary for a West<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_136"></a>[136]</span>
Indian hurricane of unusual intensity—one similar
to that which wrecked Galveston—to be considerably
deflected westward out of its normal track in
order to hit one of our coast cities north of Chesapeake
Bay so that the center of the storm would
pass over it, or near enough to cause destruction.
In Galveston there was little damage to strongly
constructed buildings of brick or stone.</p>

<p><b>The Breaking of Droughts.</b> It is most important
for the forecaster to know when and how droughts
may be broken. He will observe that when the
great cereal plains are famishing for moisture the
Lows all originate on the middle or north Rocky
Mountain plateau, in the region of Colorado or Montana,
and that the drought continues until the Lows
begin to form in the extreme southwest—in Arizona,
New Mexico, or Texas. As previously stated such
Lows always bring rain as they move northeastward.</p>

<p><b>Warm Waves.</b> There come in summer periods
of almost stagnation in the drift of the Highs and
the Lows across the continent. At such times if a
High be centered in the South Atlantic Ocean, with
its center at Bermuda, and its western limits extending
into the South Atlantic coast States, there
will result what is popularly known as a warm wave,
for the air will slowly and steadily move from the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_137"></a>[137]</span>
southeast, where the pressure is greater, towards
the northwest, where it is less; it will receive constant
accretions of heat from the radiating surface
of the earth, and finally attain to a temperature that
is extremely uncomfortable to all forms of life, that
lowers the physical stamina, and that largely increases
the death rate. This superheated condition
of the lower stratum of air in which we live continues
until a Low develops in the southwest and a High
in the northwest, which relation, as we already know,
soon brings rainfall to the interior of the country.</p>

<p><b>V-shaped Lows</b> are reasonably sure to cause precipitation,
and if the barometer at the center of the
Low be five to seven tenths below the outer limits
of the depression, heavy precipitation and destructive
local storms may be expected.</p>

<p><b>Thunderstorms.</b> The thunderstorm is caused by
cold and heavy air from above breaking through
into a lighter and superheated stratum next the
earth. Some of them have a horizontal rolling
motion which throws forward the cool air in the
direction in which the storm is moving. It seldom
is more than five or ten miles in width and twenty
to thirty miles in length. In general, thunderstorms
move from the west toward some eastern point, more
often southwest to northeast.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_138"></a>[138]</span></p>

<p>The frequency of thunderstorms is the greatest
with ill-defined Lows whose pressure is but little
below the normal air pressure of thirty inches. Any
depression of the barometer slightly below the
level at surrounding stations—such as occurs when
a weak High of only thirty inches, or thirty and
one tenth inches, breaks up into two or more areas,
with slightly lower pressure between them—is
fruitful of thunderstorms. A High of but modest
intensity advancing eastward into a region of slightly
lower pressure and much higher temperature causes
thunderstorms along its eastern front. A temperature
of 80° on the morning weather map, with a high
humidity, seldom can endure beyond the second day
without a break and the coming of cooling thunder-showers.
Any Low with abnormal heat and humidity
in its southeast quadrant is usually attended
with numerous thunder squalls in the regions of
high temperature and moisture.</p>

<p>Of the thunderstorm days in the United States
few occur in the Rocky Mountain regions or in
northern New England. The greatest number is
in Florida and the Gulf States and thence northward
up the Mississippi Valley.</p>

<p><b>The Moon Has No Influence on the Weather.</b>
The moon used to be the farmer’s most valued<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_139"></a>[139]</span>
friend as a forecaster of the weather and as a guide
in the planting of crops, but a higher order of intelligence
is causing this fallacy to pass away. The
moon’s nearness to the earth and the fact that its
phases occur in about seven days, which is about twice
the period of storm recurrence, in the minds of many
have endowed it with potency in the influencing
of our weather. Rain may occur on the same day
of the week for several weeks in succession, but
only occasionally, while the moon is constantly
progressing from one phase to another. The few
cases that prove the mistaken theory are taken as
proof conclusive, while the many cases that do not
prove acceptable to the moon forecaster are ignored
and not mentioned to his friends nor even acknowledged
to himself. One is reluctant to have a belief
disproved, no matter how ridiculous it may be. In
fact, the more untenable it is, the more tenaciously
some adhere to it, as though they were loyally standing
by an old friend who had made mistakes, but
who still was good at heart. The attraction of the
moon, because of its nearness and notwithstanding
its small mass, is far more potent in the raising of
the tides of the ocean than is the sun, but its attraction
on our atmosphere produces a tide of only
four thousandths of an inch of the barometer, an<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_140"></a>[140]</span>
influence that is shadowy and without the least
influence in causing storms, or changes of any kind in
the weather; and there is no possible way in which
the moon could influence the germination of seed
or the growing of crops.</p>

<p><b>Equinoctial Storm.</b> As the summer wanes the
Lows become more pronounced and the sporadic
showers give place to general rain storms along in
September. There is no objection to these storms
being known as “Equinoctial”, except that any
date in the latter half of September is as liable to
show a beginning of these storms as is the 21st or the
22d. The equinox simply marks the middle period in
the transition from one type of weather to another.</p>

<p><b>Forecasting from Halos.</b> The halos that sometimes
surround the sun or the moon indicate the
coming of precipitation to the extent of making
manifest the presence in the upper air of large quantities
of vapor of water in a congealed state. When
the vapor of water cools quietly in the laboratory it
frequently forms minute spheres of water, which,
strange to relate, may remain liquid all the way
down to zero and below; but if touched or jostled
they instantly turn to ice, in the form of spiculæ,
or needles; they are simply hexagonal slender
prisms capped by hexagonal pyramids. These<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_141"></a>[141]</span>
needles rotate or spin about as they fall. The
geometrical relations of the facets of the crystals
to the axis of rotation and to the line along which
they fall are a complex problem in optics. Suffice
to say that the observer, looking through a filmy
cloud of such crystals, would see in one part of the
sky a halo, in another part an arc of light, and in
other directions bright spots like the sun, all of
them arranged symmetrically with regard to the
sun and the observer’s zenith. A lunar halo is a
large ring concentric about the moon. A secondary
halo surrounds the first. Mock suns or mock
moons may appear coincident with solar or lunar
halos. The ice prisms through which one sees the
phenomena both refract and diffract the light as
it passes through the cloud and by partly decomposing
the rays render visible a part of their elementary
colors. The red is on the inside, next to
which is a little yellow or green, with bluish white
on the outside. In coronas, which are much smaller,
the red is on the outside. A detailed description of
these phenomena may be found in Moore’s <cite class="fsnormal">“Descriptive
Meteorology”</cite> (Appleton).</p>

<p><b>Tornadoes.</b> The cyclone has a diameter of a
thousand to two thousand miles, the hurricane about
one to three hundred and the tornado only one to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_142"></a>[142]</span>
ten hundred <em>feet</em>. The hurricane is much more
destructive than the cyclone, and the tornado is
incomparably greater in velocity of gyration and
rending force than the hurricane. New England,
Florida, and the wide region including the eastern
slope of the Rocky Mountains westward to the
Pacific are nearly free from the atmospheric convulsions
that cause the tornadoes, and they are infrequent
in any Atlantic coast State, but numerous in the
States bordering on the Mississippi River, and in
the eastern halves of Oklahoma, Kansas, and Nebraska.
During a year of great frequency of tornadoes,
about ninety storms occurred, while during
some other years the number has been as low as
twenty. The direction generally is toward the northeast.
The average rate of movement of the
tornado cloud is about twenty-five miles per hour
and the width of its destructive path only five hundred
to one thousand feet; the time of passage is less
than half a minute. It does not come upon one
unseen and unheralded. Many times the advancing
funnel-shaped clouds may be seen, and they
always are accompanied by a great roar which may
be heard for miles. Except a tornado cellar, the
cellar of a frame house is the safest place. The
writer has examined either the wrecks or the records<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_143"></a>[143]</span>
of hundreds of tornadoes and does not know of a
single case of a person being killed by a tornado in the
cellar of a frame house. If one is in the open and
a tornado approaches, never flee to the north or
to the east, but rather to the northwest, and one
needs to travel but a short distance to pass out of
the track of the monster. The tornado always
twists counter clockwise, the same as the cyclone
in whose southeast quadrant it nearly always occurs.
On the southeast side of the path there are indrafts;
so that it is safer, unless the track of the oncoming
storm is clearly seen to be well to the north of the
observer, for one to run toward the northwest.
Persons have stood near to the north side of a tornado
track during its passage without suffering
injury. If a cave, the cellar of a frame house, or a
narrow ditch cannot be reached, the best thing to do
is to lie flat on the ground as far from buildings and
trees as possible.</p>

<p>The tornado is essentially an American storm,
doubtless caused by the running together, in the
southeast quadrant of a cyclone, of cold northwest
currents and warm winds from the southeast, at a
time when the latter are saturated with moisture.
They are confined almost entirely to the region
between the two great mountain systems of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_144"></a>[144]</span>
continent, none occurring in the Rocky Mountains
and but few east of the Alleghanies. The north and south
trend of our mountain systems, quite
different from the systems of Europe and Asia,
facilitates the coming together of conflicting winds
of widely different temperatures in the lower reaches
of the atmosphere where there is an abundance of
water vapor; no tornadic whirls probably can occur
without an abundance of water vapor and the
energizing effect of the heat liberated in the whirling
cloud as this vapor is suddenly carried aloft and
liberated by condensation right in the center of the
disturbance. Because of the relation of the trend
of its great mountain systems to its oceans, the
United States occupies a somewhat unique position
meteorologically in the world. Its atmospheric
conditions are more active than those of any other
continent, which conditions are beneficial to the
people of this country.</p>

<p><b>When to Watch the Weather Map for Tornadoes.</b>
The four conditions essential to the formation of
tornadoes are as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>1. A cyclone, the center of which is to the north
or northwest;</p>

<p>2. An isotherm of 70° or over extending from
the southeast well up into the center of the cyclone,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_145"></a>[145]</span>
and then passing outward toward the southwest,
all inside the southeast quadrant of the Low;</p>

<p>3. Excessive humidity;</p>

<p>4. Time of year March 15 to June 15.</p>
</div>

<figure class="figcenter illowp100" id="i_fig17" style="max-width: 50em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_p144a.jpg" alt="St. Louis storm">
  <figcaption class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 17.—Tornado Cloud.</span></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>If any one of the four foregoing conditions be
absent, tornadoes are not liable to occur. The
reason why spring and early summer is the time when
tornadoes are most frequent is because the earth
and a thin stratum of air immediately next the earth
are heated up rapidly with the gaining heat of the
sun’s rays in the spring, while the air a short distance
aloft still retains much of the cold of winter. At this
time cyclonic action may bring together air masses
of widely different temperatures, especially when
the upper layers on the west side of the Low are
drawn down and commingled with the hot and
humid surface winds of the southeast quadrant.</p>

<p><b>Tornadoes Not Increasing.</b> The writer does not
indorse the theory that the number of these storms
is increasing; that the breaking of the virgin soil
of the prairie, the planting or the cutting away of the
forests, the drainage of land surfaces by tiles, the
stringing of thousands of miles of wire, or the laying
of iron and steel rails have materially altered the
climate or contributed to the frequency or the
intensity of storms. To be sure, as population<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_146"></a>[146]</span>
becomes more dense greater destruction will ensue
with the same number of storms.</p>

<p><b>Difficult to Forecast Tornadoes.</b> It is not possible
for the forecaster to warn the exact cities
and towns that will be struck by tornadoes without
unduly alarming many places that will wholly
escape injury. What we know is that tornadoes
are almost wholly confined to the southeast quadrant
of a cyclone, and that when the thermal, hygrometric,
and time conditions are favorable, a region
about one or two hundred miles square will be sacrificed
by a number of these atmospheric twisters. One
of the most destructive tornadoes of record devastated
St. Louis in the afternoon of May 27, 1896.
The abnormal heat and humidity of a rather small
and weak cyclone centered in eastern Kansas on the
morning weather map of that day, caused the
Weather Bureau to distribute tornado forecasts at
10 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span> throughout all of Missouri. The schools
of St. Louis were dismissed and the children sent
home on receipt of the warning, and although some
eight or ten separate tornadoes touched various
parts of the State and the people were prepared for
their coming, so many people were terrorized by the
warning in communities that were not harmed, that
the writer, then Chief of the Weather Bureau, at<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_147"></a>[147]</span>
once issued orders forbidding the specific forecasting
of tornadoes in the future. Under tornadic
conditions the forecast is for “conditions favorable
for severe local storms.”</p>

<p><b>Freaks of the Tornado.</b> The writer was in St.
Louis the day after the storm and spent much time
in examining the wreckage. He was impressed with
the fact that some buildings were burst outward
and that all four walls fell away from their bases,
indicating that the tornado cloud must have lifted
and dropped down over them in such a way that
the partial vacuum that is created by the rotating
cloud through centrifugal force so reduced the pressure
of the air on the outside of the houses that the
normal pressure of fifteen pounds per square inch
exploded them. He saw bricks in a plastered wall
that were neatly cleaned of all plaster by the expansion
of the air inside the brick, as the air pressure
from the outside was reduced. He saw a two
by four pine scantling shot through five eighths of
solid iron on the Eads Bridge, the pine stick protruding
several feet through the iron side of the roadway,
exemplifying the old principle of shooting a
candle through a board. He saw a six by eight
piece of timber driven four feet almost straight
down into the hard compact soil, a gardener’s spade<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_148"></a>[148]</span>
shot six inches into the tough body of a tree, a chip
driven through the limb of a tree, and wheat straws
forced into the body of a tree to the depth of over
half an inch. Such was the fearful velocity of the
wind as it gyrated about the small center of the
tornado,—a velocity exceeding that of any rifle
bullet. (See <a href="#i_fig17">Figures 17</a>, <a href="#i_fig18-19">18</a>, <a href="#i_fig18-19">19</a>, and <a href="#i_fig20">20</a>.)</p>

<p>Some have advocated the planting of trees to the
southwest of cities in the regions where tornadoes
are frequent, so that the tornadoes may expend their
energy in uprooting the trees before they come to the
city, but this storm traveled through several miles
of brick buildings, razing them to the ground and
almost pulverizing them and still left the city apparently
with greater force than it had on entering.
The largest trees would offer no more resistance to
a tornado cloud than would so many blades of grass.</p>

<p>When the official forecasts contain the statement
that conditions are favorable for “severe local
storms” it would be well to carefully observe the
formation of portentous clouds in the west and
southwest, between 3 and 6 o’clock in the afternoon,
and if one with black, ragged fringes on its
lower edge and accompanied with a noise like several
railroad trains makes its appearance, seek safety
in the cellar of a frame house.</p>

<p><b>General Rules for Forecastings.</b> What has gone
before in this chapter gives an idea of what guides
the weather forecaster in making his deductions.
In brief, he studies the developments and the movements
of the Highs and the Lows during the past
two or three days, as shown by preceding weather
maps, and from the knowledge gained forecasts
the future course and intensity of the fair and the
foul weather areas for one, two, or three days in advance.
By preserving the weather map each day
and noting the movements of the Highs and the
Lows, any intelligent person can make a fairly
accurate forecast for himself, always remembering
that the Lows, as they drift towards him, will bring
warmer weather and sometimes rain or snow, and
that as they pass his place of observation the Highs
following in the tracks of the Lows will bring cooler
and fair weather, except during periods of extreme
summer heat, when the Lows bring showers that
cool the parched earth; and except in the north
Rocky Mountain plateau, where most of the precipitation
occurs after the center of the Low has
passed and northwest winds are blowing.</p>

<p>The amateur weather forecaster can closely anticipate
the temperature of his region by remembering
that the weather will be cool and the humidity<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_150"></a>[150]</span>
low so long as the center of the predominating High
(the High inclosing the greatest area within the
thirty-inch isobar) is north of his latitude, either
northeast or northwest, and that it will be warm so
long as the High is south of the parallel of latitude
that passes through his section of country.</p>

<p>He will find that the centers of the Lows will
follow closely the direction indicated by the isotherms
that lead eastward out of their centers, and that they
move across the country from the west in quite
regular succession, and that the frequent changes
from sunshine to clouds and from warm to cold are
the result of the mixing of the air by these atmospheric
eddies.</p>

<p>Experience will teach him that Lows from the
southwest are reasonably sure of causing precipitation,
and that if his temperature be sufficiently
low—anywhere from zero to 20°—the fall will
be in the shape of snow; that Lows that only skirt
our northern border will be deficient in precipitation,
even if they cause any at all; that the slow settling of
a High over the South Atlantic States means heat
for all the rest of the country east of the Rocky
Mountains in degree that will be dependent upon
the magnitude and the intensity of the southern
High; that the heat will continue, even if temporarily<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_151"></a>[151]</span>
interrupted by showers, so long as this
High retains its location in the southeast; that
tornadoes occur in the spring of the year when
Lows have excessive heat and humidity in their
southeast quadrants; that V-shaped Lows cause
violent local storms, if not tornadoes, and often
deluges of rain; and that frosts may be expected
in the country when a minimum temperature of
40° is forecast for the city; and that the severity
of cold waves modifies as they come eastward,
and that they will only flow as far south as the area
covered by the Low that preceded them,—that
is to say, by that part of the Low included in the
thirty-inch isobar, or by a close approximation to
such area.</p>

<p>National Forecaster E. H. Bowie, known to the
writer as one of the ablest forecasters ever developed
by the Weather Bureau, in a recent most valuable
publication by the Bureau, entitled <cite class="fsnormal">“Weather
Forecasting in the United States”</cite>, formulates rules
for forecasting as follows:</p>

<p>1. When there is an area of high pressure over
the southeast and a cold wave in the northwest
threatens, there will be a storm development in the
southwest and precipitation will be general.</p>

<p>2. If a storm form in the southwest and be forced<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_152"></a>[152]</span>
to the left of a normal track (<a href="#i_ch10">Charts 10</a> and <a href="#i_ch11">11</a>), another
storm will immediately begin to develop in the
southwest and it becomes a sure rain producer.
Storms that develop in the southwest and move
normally are quickly followed by clearing weather.</p>

<p>3. Troughs of low pressure moving from the
west are of two types—the narrow and the wide.
The former moves eastward slowly and storm centers
develop in the extreme northern and the extreme
southern ends. When the trough is wide, the
development of an extensive storm area is not uncommon,
especially if the wide intervening area
between the Highs shows relatively high temperatures.</p>

<p>4. When the northern end of a trough moves
eastward faster than the southern end, the weather
conditions in the south and southwest remain unsettled
and the chances are that a storm will form
southwest of the High that follows. When the
southern end moves faster than the northern end,
settled weather follows.</p>

<p>5. Storms that start in the northwest and move
southeastward do not gather great intensity until
they begin to recurve to the northward. At the
time of recurving they move slowly, as a rule, and
care must be exercised in predicting clearing weather.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_153"></a>[153]</span></p>

<p>6. Marked changes in temperature in the southeast
and northwest quadrants imply an increase
in the storm’s intensity. Small temperature changes
do not indicate a further development of the storm.</p>

<p>7. Abnormally high temperatures northwest of
a storm indicate that it will either retrograde or
remain stationary.</p>

<p>8. East of the Rocky Mountains, a storm which
moves to the left of its normal track increases in
intensity.</p>

<p>9. Storms with isobars closely crowded on the
west and northwest generally move slowly and to the
east or southeast, and the precipitation and high
winds are maintained unusually long in the northern
and western quadrants.</p>

<p>10. Storms with the isobars closely crowded in
the south and southeast quadrants move rapidly
northeastward and the weather quickly clears after
the passage of the storm center.</p>

<p><b>Rules for Making Local Forecasts.</b> As an illustration
of what may be done by the local observer
or the layman in formulating rules of weather forecasting
for his immediate vicinities, the following
rules, which were evolved by the writer in 1892,
while serving as the Weather Bureau local forecaster
for Milwaukee, Wisconsin, are subjoined:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_154"></a>[154]</span></p>

<p>1. In summer warmer weather occurs after the
center of the Low has passed a little to the east,
and southwest winds are blowing, because the easterly
winds, which otherwise would be the warmest winds,
are cooled by passing over the lake.</p>

<p>2. A Low from the northwest that reaches western
Minnesota and western Iowa without precipitation
or clouds will pass over Wisconsin as a dry Low,
unless the isobars are closer than five eighths of an
inch.</p>

<p>3. Light frosts will occur on clear, quiet nights
in the cranberry marshes when minimum temperatures
at Duluth and La Crosse fall to 40° and 45°
respectively. When these stations record five degrees
lower the frost will be killing in the cranberry
marshes and light in the tobacco fields of the southern
counties of the State.</p>

<p>4. No frost will occur in the counties bordering
on Lake Michigan until the temperatures at the
Weather Bureau stations fall close to the freezing
point, such is the influence of the lake in storing up
heat and slowly radiating it during the night; and on
the eastern side of the lake its protecting influence
is much greater.</p>

<p>5. When the wind sets in from points between
south and southeast and the barometer falls steadily,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_155"></a>[155]</span>
a storm is approaching from the west or northwest,
and its center will pass near or north of the observer
within twelve to twenty-four hours, with wind shifting
to northwest by way of south and southwest.
When the wind sets in from points between east and
northeast and the barometer falls steadily, a storm
is approaching from the south or southwest, and its
center will pass near or to the south of the observer
within twelve to twenty-four hours, with wind shifting
to northwest by way of north. The rapidity of
the storm’s approach and its intensity will be indicated
by the rate and the amount of the fall in the
barometer.</p>

<p><b>Vast Extent of the Area Brought Under Observation.</b>
It is a wonderful panoramic picture of atmospheric
conditions which, by the aid of the electro-magnetic
telegraph and two hundred simultaneously
reporting stations, is presented to the eye of the
forecaster. Each day the kaleidoscope changes
and a new graphic picture comes into view. Nowhere
else in the world can the student of the weather
find such opportunities.</p>

<p>Early meteorologists studied only the storm of
low levels and humid airs, where convection only
needed to carry the moist air currents to but a
slightly higher elevation before cooling by expansion<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_156"></a>[156]</span>
would produce condensation and an immediate
acceleration of the cyclone by the liberation of
latent heat within the region of the upward-moving
air in its central area. They never had seen the
cyclones of the arid northern Rocky Mountain
plateau move down to our Great Lakes with rapidly
increasing energy, notwithstanding the fact that
there had been little condensation, and hence no
addition of the latent heat that Espy supposed was
essential to a continuation of storms.</p>

<p>The widely differing elevation, topography, temperature,
and moisture of the broad region under
observation by the United States Weather Bureau
present conditions unequaled for the study of every
phase of storm development and translation, or at
least such as may be comprehended from data taken
on the bottom of the atmospheric ocean; and it is
but a matter of a short time when the data for
extremely high levels will be added.</p>

<p>Here we see summer cyclones formed under the
intense solar radiation that beats down through a
nearly diathermanous atmosphere upon the wastes
of the Rocky Mountain plateaus; cyclones that,
if they form in the northern part of the plateau
region, move eastward to our Lakes and thence
eastward to the St. Lawrence with scant rainfall;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_157"></a>[157]</span>
cyclones that, if they have their origin farther
south in the region of Colorado, move into the
Ohio Valley and thence to New England with considerably
more precipitation; and cyclones that, if
they have their origin anywhere in our southwest
States or Texas, or enter our region of observation
from the South Pacific Ocean, can always be expected
to cause general rainfall when they reach the Lower
Mississippi Valley and later as they pass up through
the central portions of the continent.</p>

<p>Here also one may view the great winter cyclones
that originate in the Pacific between Hawaii and
the Aleutian Islands and come under our vision as
they successfully surmount the formidable barriers
of the Rocky Mountains with but little diminution
of energy, sweep across our continent with
increasing force and heavy precipitation, and within
three days pass beyond our meteorological horizon at
the Atlantic seaboard only to be heard from several
days later as boreal ravagers of Northern Europe.</p>

<p>The great anti-cyclones that constitute the American
cold waves drift into our territory from Canadian
Northwest provinces, and are studied under rapidly
changing conditions during three thousand miles
of their course.</p>

<p>West Indian hurricanes, at sea level and in humid<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_158"></a>[158]</span>
air, which are the most violent of all storms except
the American tornado, intrude themselves into the
domain covered by the weather map at Florida or
the East Gulf coast and usually pass off to the
northeast with high winds skirting our southern
coast stations.</p>

<p><b>Permanent Highs and Lows in the Pacific Are
Great Centers of Action.</b> Near the end of <a href="#CHAPTER_XII">Chapter
XII</a> reference is made to the fact that there is
a barrier in the Pacific Ocean that interferes with the
movement of storms from the Orient, but which
does not entirely stop their progress. Extensive
Highs and Lows, sometimes called “Centers of
Action” because they do not migrate like the traveling
Highs and Lows that cause the alternations of
weather that we experience from day to day, are also
called Sub-permanent Highs and Lows. They are
the parent systems out of which come many of the
Highs and Lows that cross the North American
continent, and they act as a bar to the free passage
of storms from the Far East. As these Sub-permanent
areas shift their centers a little to the north
or to the south they change the character and the
line of movement of the storms and cool waves that
come to us, and they alter the general character of
the weather for thousands of miles to the east of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_159"></a>[159]</span>
them. In the region of Iceland is the center of an
extensive Sub-permanent Low that has much to do
in controlling the weather of Europe, and there is
a Sub-permanent High central at or near Bermuda
in the southern part of the North Atlantic Ocean.
Whenever the latter is built up by having a migrating
High from the North American continent
join with it, the whole United States experiences
what is called a “hot wave”, and the heat continues
as long as this Sub-permanent High remains unusually
high and extends its western limits to include
our South Atlantic States.</p>

<p>The matter in the foregoing paragraph is so
important that it will be restated in slightly different
form: Whenever either the High or the Low Center
of Action (Sub-permanent High and Low), out of
which comes nearly all of the migrating Highs and
Lows, shifts its normal seasonal position, then
storms are erratic and unusual weather occurs over
the North American continent and farther eastward.
The reason why much the greater number of the
storms that cross the United States, the Atlantic
Ocean, and Europe originate either in our Rockies,
the Canadian Northwest, or just off the Alaskan
coast is due to the fact (<a href="#i_ch1">Chart 1</a>, page 99) that
the Low center of action is normally over the middle<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_160"></a>[160]</span>
and northern Rocky Mountain plateau in summer,
and over the Aleutian Islands (<a href="#i_ch2">Chart 2</a>, page 100)
in winter. The High that follows the migrating
Low in winter either separates from the center of
action central over the Canadian Rockies (<a href="#i_ch2">Chart 2</a>),
or from the one central at Honolulu; if from the
latter, the weather will be simply cooler after the
passage of the Low, but if the High separates from
the center of action in the Canadian Rockies it will
constitute a cold wave as it follows a Low southeastward
into the interior of the United States and then
eastward to the coast.</p>

<p><b>Difference between Climate and Weather.</b> One
may speak of the weather of to-day or of some time
that is past, but not of the climate of to-day, or of
any day, month, or year that is gone: for the climate
of a place is determined by a study of its weather
records for a long period of years. Climate changes
so slowly that we speak of the movement as a
mutation rather than as a change. The time that
has elapsed since the discovery of the barometer and
the thermometer—about two and a half centuries—is
so short as to show little if any change in
climate, while the weather changes from day to day.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_162"></a>[162]</span></p>

<p><b>The Sun Our Only Source of Appreciable Heat.</b>
Each one of the stars visible to the eye and many
of the millions that are not visible, are suns accompanied
by planets. Their conditions are similar
to those of our sun, except that most of them are
larger than our sun, some a million times larger.
But their distance is so great that they exercise
little or no influence in the heating of the earth.
Light travels at about the rate of 186,400 miles per
second, and yet these stars are so distant that if the
nearest one had been created at the time of the signing
of the Declaration of Independence we still
would be in ignorance of its existence, for its first
rays of light would not reach us for many years yet
to come; and light from some of the remote suns
that we call stars requires thousands of years to
come. It is apparent therefore that we depend
exclusively upon our own luminary for the heat
that warms our atmosphere and gives life to the
surface of the earth.</p>

<p><b>Different Temperatures with the Same Quantity
of Solar Heat.</b> On the same day of each year at
the same place practically the same amount of heat
falls upon and into the earth’s atmosphere from the
sun, but rarely does the same temperature and
weather occur, and often there is wide variation in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_163"></a>[163]</span>
the weather of the same day of two different years.
The first of July may be cold enough to wear an
overcoat at midday,
or the first of January
may be so temperate
as to permit the donning
of summer habiliments,
while, according
to the amount
of heat received from
the sun, there would
have occurred the
usual seasonal conditions
on the days
named had there been no other influence than the
direct action of the sun’s heat. The cause of these
seeming inconsistencies is due to the motions of the
atmosphere in a stratum only five to seven miles in
depth, air cooling by expansion as it ascends in cyclonic
whirls and heating as it descends in anti-cyclonic
movements. Condensation, in the form of
cloud or rain or snow, also introduces complications,
usually producing a cooling effect in summer and a
warming in winter. In other words: interference in
the uniform and gradual change in temperature, of
the lower stratum of air in which we live, from the heat<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_164"></a>[164]</span>
of summer to the cold
of winter, and then
the reverse process, is
due entirely to the
heating and the cooling
of the lower air by
its upward and downward
motions.</p>

North Pole is dark now instead of light,
as at Summer Solstice. Pole leans in
same direction but Earth being on opposite
side of its orbit rays come from opposite
direction. Refer to <a href="#i_fig24">Figure 24</a>.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>If the earth’s axis
were vertical to the
plane of its orbit all
places on its surface always would have days of
twelve hours each and the nights would be of the
same length; sunshine
would just
touch both poles
(<a href="#i_fig21">Figure 21</a>) throughout
the entire course
of the earth around
the sun and there
would be no seasons.
One would need to
change one’s location
on the earth in order
to get a change of
weather, which would<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_165"></a>[165]</span>
be monotonous and quite different from the active
conditions of the atmosphere that we now enjoy.
The whole conditions of life would be altered for
the worse. You have seen a top tilt over to one
side as it spun on the floor. In the same way the
earth spins on its axis as it pursues its course
around the sun without changing the direction towards
which its axis points, as shown by <a href="#i_fig24">Figure 24</a>.</p>

</figure>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_166"></a>[166]</span></p>

<p>The intensity of the sun’s rays at sunrise and at
sunset is less than at midday because the quantity
of heat received at the outer limits of the atmosphere
on a given area, as for instance at the area of the
upper ends of the blocks in <a href="#i_fig25">Figure 25</a>, passes through
a deeper stratum of air the lower the angle of incidence,
and because it is distributed over a larger
area when it reaches the surface of the earth.</p>

<p>As the heat of day increases from morning until
midday and then decreases, so does the heat of the
year increase from midwinter to midsummer and
then decrease, and for the same reason: change
in obliquity of the sun’s rays, to which must be
added change in distance from the central luminary.
<a href="#i_fig26">Figure 26</a> shows that the sun reaches its greatest
midday altitude on June 21st and its least on December
21st.</p>

</figure>

<p><b>Solar Rays Absorbed by the Atmosphere.</b> The
atmosphere of the earth absorbs about seventy-six
per cent. of the solar rays that pass through it.
About one half is absorbed by a cloudless atmosphere,
and nearly all is absorbed or reflected away
by a cloudy air. On the average about fifty-two per
cent. of the earth’s surface is obscured by clouds
all the time, which reduces the total amount of heat
that reaches the earth to but twenty-four per cent.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_167"></a>[167]</span>
But in regions like the high plateau of the Rocky
Mountains, where there is little cloudiness or moisture
in the air, fully fifty per cent. reach the earth.
At the equator, when the sun is in the zenith at
noon, the rays strike the earth perpendicularly and
reach the earth through the shortest air distance
possible; but for latitudes far north or south of the
equator, the rays are more oblique and must pass
through an ever-increasing thickness of air as the
latitude increases. Consequently the heat that
reaches the earth at high latitudes decreases, not
only on account of the greater obliquity of the
sun’s rays, but also because of the longer path of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_168"></a>[168]</span>
atmosphere traversed, which causes a further loss
by absorption.</p>

<p><b>The Lag of Earth Temperatures.</b> The solar
rays reach their greatest intensity on June 21st,
in the Northern Hemisphere, when the sun attains
the farthest point north, and the obliquity of its
rays is the least, but the highest temperature of the
air for the year does not occur on the average for a
month or six weeks later, due to the capacity of the
earth and air to absorb heat; and the maximum for
the earth does not occur until still later. The sun
is the farthest south on December 21st, but the
minimum air temperature of the year, on the average,
does not occur until a month later, and at a
later period in the earth. At Munich, Bavaria, at
a depth of four feet, the minimum annual temperature
occurs on the 2d of March, and the maximum
on the 24th of August. For each increase of four
feet in depth the time of occurrence of either maximum
or minimum temperature is retarded twenty-one
days, the minimum not occurring until the 23d
of May at a <ins class="corr" id="tn-168" title="Transcriber’s Note—Original text: 'depth of 20.2,°'">
depth of 20.2°,</ins> and the maximum being
retarded until the 17th of November.</p>

<p><b>Annual Range in Air Temperature.</b> The difference
in temperature between winter and summer increases
from the equator northward and from all<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_169"></a>[169]</span>
oceans toward the interior of continents, and is
greater in the middle latitudes on the eastern side
of large bodies of land than on their western side.
Yakutsk, Siberia, has experienced 80° below zero
in January and 102° above in July, making a range
of 182°. Dawson, Canada, has a record of 68°
below for winter and 94° above for summer, making
a range of 162°. In marked contrast with these
large differences, shown in the northern interior
of continents, is the annual range at Samoa, from
a maximum of 92° to a minimum of 62°, a range
for the year of only 30° for this island of the Pacific,
located near the equator.</p>

<p><b>Reversal of the Seasons in the Two Hemispheres.</b>
The summer is shorter in the Southern Hemisphere
than in the Northern and the winter is longer, but
the Southern Hemisphere is nearer to the sun in
the summer and farther away in winter, conditions
that tend to add to the extremes of both seasons.
Because of the slowness of the earth in passing
through one half of its orbit, the northern summer
lasts ninety-three days, while that of the Southern
Hemisphere lasts but eighty-nine days. The result
is that during like seasons and during the whole year
the two hemispheres receive exactly the same quantity
of heat.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_170"></a>[170]</span></p>

<p><b>Only Water Vapor Protects the Earth from Death
by Freezing.</b> In <a href="#CHAPTER_IV">Chapter IV</a> you are told that the
earth is surrounded by four atmospheres that
conduct themselves each quite independently of the
others, and that water vapor (aqueous vapor) is
one of them. Water vapor plays the most important
part in absorbing incoming rays and in absorbing
and reflecting back outgoing heat rays from the
earth. Without the vaporous atmosphere the sun’s
rays would be but slightly absorbed as they entered
and radiation from the earth would readily escape
through the atmosphere to outer space. No matter
how fiercely the sun might shine, life on the earth
would be entirely destroyed by cold.</p>

<p>When water vapor, clouds, or dust motes intercept
certain portions of the sun’s rays, they change them
from vibrations in ether to the motions of molecules,
and the motions of these molecules are expressed in
a rise in temperature in the vapor, cloud, or dust.
Earth radiations of heat, having longer and slower
wave lengths than those that come from the sun,
are more readily absorbed by the atmosphere.</p>

<p>One of the principal functions of the atmosphere
is to protect the earth from the intense cold of outer
space, which must be near or at absolute zero—459°
below the zero mark.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_171"></a>[171]</span></p>

<p><b>Why Should Not Mountain Peaks Be Warm?
They Are Nearer the Sun.</b> The absorption by the
atmosphere of both solar and terrestrial radiation
is greater in the lower levels of the air, where water
vapor, cloud, and dust are the densest, while the
transmission of both incoming and outgoing radiation
is more rapid through the pure air aloft. Thus
we account for the coolness of all mountain peaks,
and the perpetual freezing temperatures of some,
even though they be located in the tropics, and
though their tops occupy positions several miles
nearer the sun than the bases from which they rise.</p>

<p><b>How the Earth Cools at Night.</b> Radiation from
the earth goes on day and night, winter and summer.
During daylight the gain of heat is greater
than the loss, while at night the reverse is true.
After sunset both the earth and the air continue to
cool by radiation unchecked by the incoming heat
of the daytime. The earth loses heat, even under
a clear sky, more freely than the air, with the result
that the surface of the ground and of vegetation
may fall to a temperature ten to fifteen degrees
lower than that of the air at a few hundred feet
elevation. This condition is called “temperature
inversion.” The greater difference will occur when
there is little wind to mix the air. On a clear night<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_172"></a>[172]</span>
the radiation outward will be rapid; then, if the wind
be light, there may occur an increase in temperature
up to a height of two hundred to four hundred
feet, and then a fall, reaching the surface temperature
at about two thousand feet elevation, unless the
ground be wet, or the location be adjacent to a
considerable body of water.</p>

<p><b>A Cloud Covering Cools by Day and Warms by
Night.</b> One of the principal functions of clouds
is to conserve the heat of the sun. A covering of
cloud, fog, or dense haze may not only screen off
the heat of day, but greatly retard the lowering of
temperature at night by reflecting and radiating
back to the ground much of the heat that it has lost.</p>

<p><b>The Temperature of Oceans, Lakes, and Rivers.</b>
The same quantity of heat falling upon different
kinds of matter produces different temperatures, depending
on the capacity (specific heat) of each kind
of matter to absorb or hold heat; this is notably
apparent when the matter is land, water, or air; for
the same quantity of heat will raise the temperature
of a water surface only about one fourth as much
as it will a land surface. Water rejects by reflection
a considerable amount of the solar rays that fall
upon it, while land reflects but a small part; and
of that which is received upon the top layer of water<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_173"></a>[173]</span>
much is rendered latent in the process of evaporation
and does not impart warmth to the water. Solar
rays also penetrate water to a considerable depth
and are quite uniformly absorbed by the whole
stratum penetrated. These conditions cause large
water surfaces and the air immediately over them
to have a much lower temperature during the day
and a much higher temperature during the night;
and also lower temperatures during summer and
higher temperatures during winter, than occur over
a land surface of the same latitude.</p>

<p><b>Fresh Water and Salt Water Have Different
Freezing Temperatures.</b> In the ratio of 93.5 to
100 the specific heat of sea water is less than that
of fresh water. Sea water is a better conductor
of heat, so that it penetrates to a greater depth
in salt water in the same period of time than it
does in fresh water. Sea water regularly contracts
with falling temperature until its greatest density
occurs at four degrees below freezing, when it
becomes solid ice and expands in the process of
freezing; otherwise it would not float.</p>

<p><b>A Wonderful Phenomenon.</b> In this respect a most
wonderful and unexplainable phenomenon occurs with
regard to fresh water. Not only sea water but
practically all other forms of matter—liquid, solid,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_174"></a>[174]</span>
and gaseous—expand with increasing heat and
contract with decreasing heat, except fresh water
between 39° and 32°, which actually expands with
falling temperature. It seems as though the Creator
had gone over His work and made revisions and
corrections here and there, for unless the law with
regard to the contraction of liquids with falling temperatures
had been reversed for fresh water between
39° and 32° our rivulets, streams, lakes, and rivers
would freeze from the bottom upward and the life
of inland water be wholly or partly destroyed.</p>

<p>Even more calamitous would be the floods of
springtime, for melting snows and falling rains
would spread over and erode the cultivated fields
of the husbandman instead of being carried away by
the open channels of streams, as is largely done now.</p>

<p><b>The Freezing of Fresh and of Salt Bodies of Water.</b>
The freezing of water does not take place upon the
surface of water only, as many suppose. Congelation
takes place about millions of minute atoms of
matter carried by the water in suspension. Water
expands in the process of freezing and each particle
of ice, no matter in what part of the body of water
it is formed, immediately rises to the surface because
of the gain in its buoyance as it changes from the
liquid to the solid form.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_175"></a>[175]</span></p>

<p>When the surface of water cools by radiation to
a cooler air it gains in specific gravity and sinks
and warmer water comes up to take its place and
in turn be cooled and sink; thus a circulation
is established which continues in fresh water
until every part of the body of water has fallen
to 39° and in salt water to 28°. At these temperatures
the two waters reach their maximum
density. With the further cooling of salt water
particles of ice form and rise to the top, as already
described. With the cooling of fresh water below
39° the law that holds good for all higher temperatures
is reversed and expansion of volume begins,
which continues until 32° is reached. Therefore,
fresh water of any temperature between 39° and 32°
may float upon water that is considerably warmer;
in fact, it has less specific gravity at 32° than at 46°.
At 32° that which was a liquid becomes a solid and
still further suddenly expands its volume.</p>

<p><b>The Cold of Ocean Bottoms.</b> Few have any
idea of the enormous volume of cold water that
lies upon the surface of the earth, three fourths of
which is covered with oceans whose depths average
two miles and in many places are five miles. Below
one mile in depth these oceans are always at about
the freezing point of salt water, which is 28°,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_176"></a>[176]</span>
except in the tropics, where it is but little warmer,
varying between 34° and 36°.</p>

<p><b>How Temperatures of Inclosed Seas Differ from
Those of Oceans.</b> We will take the Red Sea as
an example. It is 180 miles wide and extends in
a nearly north and south direction for 1450 miles,
about one half of it lying within the tropics. Evaporation
takes place at a rapid rate, but only the
surface water of the Indian Ocean on the south
is able to enter to take the place of that which is
lost, for a bar or sill at the entrance, extending
from the bottom to within twelve hundred feet of
the surface, separates the deep water of the sea
from that of the outside ocean. Its surface temperatures
vary about as the Indian Ocean, being
85° in summer and 70° in winter. Both bodies of
water decrease in temperature at about the same
rate down to the level of the sill, where the temperature
remains constant the year through at
70°. Here a marked difference occurs, for the
sea, which has a depth of 7200 feet, maintains the
same temperature of 70° all the way down to the
bottom; while the ocean continues to decrease
in temperature down to a depth of about six thousand
feet, where a temperature of 34° to 36° prevails
throughout the year. A similar condition exists<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_177"></a>[177]</span>
with relation to the Mediterranean and the Atlantic
Ocean. At the top of the sill, which is 1140 feet
below the surface, the temperature of both bodies
is 55°, and this degree of heat is maintained all the
way down to the bottom of the Mediterranean,
while in the Atlantic Ocean, at the same depth as
the bottom of the Mediterranean, the temperature
is only 35°.</p>

<p><b>How the Temperature of Water Changes with
Latitude, Season, and Depth.</b> It is impossible to
name a given temperature as prevailing over bodies
of water at all places on the same parallel of latitude,
because ocean currents soon move water heated in
one latitude to a higher or a lower position. At the
equator the surface temperature is between 82°
and 84°; it changes less than one degree between
day and night, and not over five degrees between
winter and summer; and below twenty-four hundred
feet there is no difference between the seasons, the
daily variation ceasing at less than a hundred feet.
Below six thousand feet the temperature is always
near the freezing point of fresh water.</p>

<p>In the middle latitudes the surface variation is
from 50° in winter to 68° in summer.</p>

<p>At latitude 70° N. the surface temperature has
but a small daily variation, and a yearly range of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_178"></a>[178]</span>
from 35° for winter to 45° for summer; at a depth
of twenty-four hundred feet it remains steady
at 32°.</p>

<p>From this level there is a gradual decrease to a
depth of six thousand feet, where a constant temperature
of 28° exists, and below this there is no
change. The temperature of Lake Superior decreases
down to a depth of two hundred forty feet, where a
temperature of 39° continues throughout the year,
as it does downward for the remainder of the distance
to the bottom, which has an average depth
of nine hundred feet.</p>

<p><b>Direction of Wind Affects Shore Temperature of
Water.</b> Onshore winds skim off the warm surface
water and drive it shoreward, where it banks up,
and, pressing downward, causes the colder water
beneath to flow back seaward. In like manner,
offshore winds blow off the top water near the
shore and send it out to sea, and colder water rises
to take its place.</p>

<p><b>Great Heat of the Earth’s Interior.</b> We are
ignorant of the conditions of matter under the
heating effect of the enormous pressure that exists
near the center of the earth, but it is probable that
pressure prevents it from changing from a solid to
a liquid or a gaseous form. The surface of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_179"></a>[179]</span>
solid earth rises to a much higher temperature as
the solar rays fall upon it than does a water surface,
or the air immediately above, because it is a poor reflector,
a poor conductor, and a poor radiator, and
when dry does not get any cooling effect from evaporation.
Solar heat ceases to be apparent at a depth
that varies with the latitude and the conditions of
the soil with regard to moisture and specific heat,
but everywhere at less than fifty feet.</p>

<p>At the poles and for some distance away the
earth is covered with ice or snow the entire year
and is frozen to a considerable depth. In the
interior of Siberia and some parts of Alaska only
a thin stratum of soil thaws out under the heat of
summer. Beginning at about fifty feet, there is an
increase of temperature downward, but it is not
the same for all places, varying from a degree for
forty feet to a degree for one hundred feet. Taking
the average of the increase with depth, water would
boil at ninety-five hundred feet and the hardest
rock be molten at thirty miles. At a depth of
3490 feet near Berlin, the temperature was found
to be 116°, while it was only 108° at the same depth
at Wheeling, West Virginia, and in both places there
is no change from day to night or from winter
to summer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_180"></a>[180]</span></p>

<p><b>Soil Usually Warmer Than Air Next Above.</b> In
summer, June to August, the bare, dry, top soil
is warmer than the air ten feet above during all
hours of the day and night, at times the difference
being as much as forty degrees at midday. During
winter, December to February, it is slightly cooler,
except between 9 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span> and 3 <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span> when the excess
is seldom more than ten degrees. Evaporation
from a wet soil lowers its temperature below
that of the air immediately above through the
rendering latent of a large quantity of heat. A
melting snow surface also is below the temperature
of the air because of the heat employed in changing
the snow to the liquid form.</p>

<p><b>Let Mother Earth Cool and Refresh You During
the Heat of Summer.</b> How little the average man
realizes the possibilities for improving his condition
that lie close at hand. He does not know, or he is
indifferent to the fact, that only three feet from the
surface of the ground it is as cool at midday as at
midnight, and that there is no diurnal variation in
temperature below that depth, and no annual
variation below a depth of from thirty to forty feet.
If one were to set down the temperature of each day,
add the numbers at the end of the year, and divide
the sum by 365 the quotient would equal the temperature<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_181"></a>[181]</span>
always found at that place at a depth of
about thirty feet. The temperature of a deep-flowing
spring is always about the mean annual air
temperature of the place. Here is health-giving coolness
for summer and warmth for winter of which one
takes little heed and derives practically no profit.</p>

<p>Remarkable, is it not? And these beneficent
conditions are universal and available for all, except
to those crowded into congested centers of population.
The temperature is 54° in the Mammoth
Cave in Kentucky and shows no change from day to
day and from winter to summer.</p>

<p>During the extreme heat of summer and the cold
of winter many could profitably, healthfully, and
pleasantly live below ground. During such periods
the cellar of the house, which should be deep and
spacious, even extending beyond the dimensions of
the edifice above, if a continuous supply of pure air
could be forced through it, or natural ventilation
accomplished by the plan outlined below, should
be the lounging, resting, and sleeping place of the
occupants of the household. It is not impossible
or extremely difficult to change the stagnant, moist,
germ-laden, ill-smelling air of the average cellar, in
which it is positively dangerous to spend much time,
into active, pure, and delightfully healthful air,—air<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_182"></a>[182]</span>
in which the worn and weary worker from the
heat of the farmer’s field, or the artisan and the
clerk from the debilitating temperatures of the
factory and the office could recuperate from the toil
of the day, and from which they would go forth
each morning invigorated for another day’s efficient
service, instead of dragging weary limbs from hot,
sleepless beds, each morning less in energy than the
day before. As is shown in other parts of this book,
the researches of Huntington have proven conclusively
that man is at his lowest physical and
mental points of efficiency, and more subject to the
contraction of disease through weakness, in midsummer
and midwinter, and that the hotter the
summer and the colder the winter the less is his
energy and the lower is his power of resistance.</p>

<p>The whole problem is one of ventilation. While
this is simple, it must be scientifically done. The
ideal location for a living cellar is a hillside. It is
easy to install ventilators in the roof of a cellar
no matter where located, but these are of no avail
whatever if there is not adequate air drainage at
the bottom of the cellar. From the cellar in a
hillside a conduit can lead from the bottom of the
inclosure and have its opening at a lower level, thereby
accomplishing drainage and circulation, which are<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_183"></a>[183]</span>
all-important in the creating of a sanitary condition
of air under the cool earth. For each thousand
cubic feet of cellar space there should project from
the roof, to a height of at least six feet above ground,
a separate ventilator shaft of at least one square
foot cross-section dimension. A like ventilating
capacity should be provided from the bottom outward
to a lower level, but here two or more shafts
may be combined in one, so the proper capacity is
secured. During the day the draft will be upward
through this system. But at night, except when
the wind is brisk, the direction of movement of the
air is reversed, and the cool air of the minimum
temperature of night or early morning, because of
its greater density, drops down into the cellar. The
drainage shaft should be provided with a damper,
which should be closed in the early morning, about
daybreak, entrapping the cold air of night. The
lower opening should be covered with wire netting,
to exclude small animals, and the whole construction
be of concrete, rendering it imperishable and rat-proof.</p>

<p><b>Inexpensive but Efficient Cold Storage.</b> Such a
sanitary cellar as described above provides an
excellent storage for fruits and vegetables, comparing
favorably with the much more expensive<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_184"></a>[184]</span>
artificial refrigeration. By an intelligent manipulation
of the damper in the lower shaft, cool storage
may be provided for fruit and other produce in the
early fall, and protection secured against the extreme
cold of winter.</p>

<p><b>Why Does Air Cool with Ascent and Heat with
Descent?</b> If a mass of air be elevated 183 feet it
will be found to have lost one degree in temperature,
because there is less air above to exert pressure upon
it and it therefore expands to greater volume, and
in the process of expansion work is performed which
employs heat and renders it latent. One minute,
one hour, or a thousand years thereafter, if this
same air be lowered to its former elevation, it will
be compressed into its previous dimensions and the
heat energy that formerly was employed to expand
it will be restored to the sensible condition. This
ratio of 183 feet to one degree does not hold for
any extended movement, because, as soon as the
dew point of the air is reached, condensation in the
form of cloud or rain occurs and the heat of condensation
is released; that is to say, the same
quantity of heat employed to create the water
vapor at some previous time and thereby rendered
latent is now become sensible and partly makes up
for the loss by expansion as the air ascends. The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_185"></a>[185]</span>
average is therefore about three hundred feet for
one degree.</p>

<p><b>Height of Freezing Cold in the Free Air.</b> The
frost level remains constant, winter and summer,
over the equator at about eighteen thousand feet.
Elsewhere this level rises and falls with the seasons,
the amplitude of the movement increasing with
latitude and being greater over land than over
water on the same parallel.</p>

<p><b>Daily Range of Temperature in the Free Air.</b>
The difference between the temperature of day and
that of night decreases with altitude in the free air
and ceases at about eight thousand feet. It is
greatest during clear weather and least in cloudy
weather. Narrow valleys may show a greater
daily range than hilltops. When the sky is clear,
radiation from the hillsides may heat the air in a
valley to almost furnace heat at midday, while at
night the air, coming in contact with cool vegetation
higher up, chills and, gaining in weight by contraction,
flows down and collects in the valley,
making the bottom of the valley warmer during
day and colder during night than the air above.
Often moisture-laden winds precipitate much of
their water vapor as the air cools by expansion in
passing over a mountain range. These winds<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_186"></a>[186]</span>
carry a comparatively dry air over to the leeward
side of the mountain, where the daily range of
temperature will be much greater than on the
windward side at the same elevation. San Francisco,
where the prevailing winds come from the
ocean, has a less range than New York, where the
predominating winds are from the land; but New
York is influenced by its proximity to the ocean, for
its range is much less than at Denver, in the interior
of the continent. The range is less on the east side
of Lake Michigan than on the west side, as it is
with relation to all similar bodies of water.</p>

<p><b>Man Soon Adjusts Himself to Changes in Altitude.</b>
In Colonial days it was noted that horses
coming down from the mountains in North Carolina
ran swifter in the races the first day or two after
changing to a lower level. In going to a higher
altitude an increase in the number of red corpuscles
in the blood enables it to absorb oxygen more readily,
and thus compensate for the loss in the density of
the air. Because of this gain in the chemical activities
of the life current, one feels a marked increase
in strength on coming to a lower level, but the gain
lasts for only a short time before there is a readjustment
to former conditions. Persons with weak
hearts may not be able to live at an altitude of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_187"></a>[187]</span>
four thousand feet, and most people experience inconvenience,
at least, on first reaching ten thousand
feet; but nature is accommodating, and a number
of large cities prosper at altitudes of from one to
two miles.</p>

HOW CLIMATE IS MODIFIED AND CONTROLLED</h2>


<p>If the surface of the earth were all land, and the
axis of the earth’s rotation were perpendicular to
the plane of the earth’s orbit, the day and the night
would be equal everywhere, and there would be no
seasons. There would be no wind, for the friction
of the air against the rotating earth would
soon cause all levels of the atmosphere to
take up the exact easterly velocity of the solid
body below. The atmosphere would be contracted
by cold and drawn downward so as to have less
depth at the poles than at any place having latitude,
and it would be deepest at the equator, where the
direct rays of the sun would expand it to an altitude
of probably twice what it could have at the poles.
Centrifugal force—the force that causes mud to
fly off the rim of a swiftly rotating wagon wheel—would
further lower the height of the atmosphere
at the poles and cause it still more to extend outward<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_189"></a>[189]</span>
at the equator. The atmosphere would soon adjust
itself to these constant conditions and forces
and thereafter remain at rest relative to the earth.
There would be no life, for there would be no
vaporous atmosphere if the surface all were without
water. There would be extremely little heat to
disturb the atmosphere with motion, for the dry
gases of the atmosphere are practically diathermanous,
and the heat of the sun would pass out by
radiation from the burnt and parched surface of the
earth during daytime without imparting more than
a minute fraction of its energy to the atmosphere;
and at night the thin surface of the top soil that
had been heated to a furnace temperature during
sunshine would be quickly locked in the fastnesses
of intense cold—probably 200° below zero.</p>

<p>If we now incline the axis of our imaginary earth
23½°, we shall introduce seasons whose only change,
the one from the other, will be in the duration of
sunlight, as there is no water vapor to absorb and
utilize the sun’s rays in the initiation of motion and
the creation of storms. We are assuming that there
would be enough heat absorbed to prevent the
atmosphere from liquefying, which it would do at
any temperature lower than 312° below zero. If
the temperature were to fall below the liquefying<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_190"></a>[190]</span>
point of air, we would have the singular phenomenon
of the air expanding to a gas during daylight and condensing
to a liquid during nighttime, and, of course,
that would mean motion and winds, but of such a nature
that one would hardly dare speculate as to their
peculiarities.</p>

<p>We introduce these hypothetical cases for the
purpose of conveying a clearer idea of the overlapping
of conditions and the combinations of forces
that influence and control the seasons, the climate,
and the weather of the earth.</p>

<p>If the surface of the earth were all water and its
axis perpendicular to the plane of its orbit, the day
and the night would everywhere be equal and there
would be no seasons. With a water surface there
would be an atmosphere nearly if not quite saturated
with vapor of water, in other words, of practically one
hundred per cent. relative humidity. It is doubtful if
either animal or vegetable life could exist; the first
would die of internal heat, because a saturated air would
permit of no cooling by evaporation from the pores of
the skin, or from the tongue and mouth of animals that
do not perspire; and the second could not grow without
the chemical action of sunshine, which is a necessary
part of the laboratory of the leaf of every
growing plant, the sunshine acting upon the green<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_191"></a>[191]</span>
granular matter which constitutes the chlorophyll
of the plant. There would be little difference between
the temperature of day and of night—probably
not more than one degree. As the earth would
everywhere and at all times be covered with a deep
stratum of cloud there would be little loss of heat
to space by radiation and the temperature would
be excessive, rising in the tropics to near the boiling
point. We will assume that the atmosphere would
reach a stable and unchanged condition of great
heat and humidity and be without motion or precipitation.</p>

<p>If now we incline the axis of this water-covered
earth and introduce the complication of seasons,
we shall not only have variation in the hours of
sunshine, increasing as we go from the equator toward
the poles, but, the capacity of air for moisture
being less and less with falling temperature, we shall
have downpours of rain as the summer slowly merges
into fall and the latter into winter. Although
the air will be saturated, there probably will be
no rainfall from the time when the temperature
begins to rise after midwinter until it reaches
and passes the maximum heat of summer. It is fair
to assume that during the rainy period there will be
cyclonic storms with torrential precipitation, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_192"></a>[192]</span>
that the anti-cyclones that are a necessary concomitant
of cyclones, while they may cause a temporary
cessation of precipitation in the area that they
cover, by the dynamic heating of the air in their
downward motions, will be ineffective in fully clearing
away the clouds from a water-covered earth.
It is doubtful if such an earth would be suitable for
life,—certainly not for man.</p>

<p><b>The Real Earth of Land, Water, and Inclined
Axis.</b> The different manner in which land and
water surfaces absorb, radiate, and reflect the heat
from the sun has a profound influence on climate,
which also is modified by latitude, elevation above sea
level, elevation above a valley or above a surrounding
plane, direction of wind, height and trend of
direction of hills and mountains, the position of
lakes and inland seas, the relative position and
magnitude of continents and oceans, storm tracks,
and ocean currents.</p>

<p><b>Influence of Continents and Oceans on Climate.</b>
<a href="#i_ch1">Charts 1</a> and <a href="#i_ch2">2</a> (pages 99 and 100), constructed from
observations taken on ships and on land, for a long
series of years, show certain Highs and Lows of
vast extent, sometimes called “Centers of Action”,
because they do not travel across continents and
oceans, as do the migrating Highs and Lows that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_193"></a>[193]</span>
cause weather. Rather do they slowly reverse
their relative positions between winter and summer.
Continents cool by radiation in winter more rapidly
than do oceans; the air contracts, settles down and
grows denser and air flows in at the top from the
oceans and outward at the surface of the earth
toward the oceans; thus is built up the winter Highs,
or centers of action, on continents. Continents
heat up by absorption in summer more rapidly than
do oceans; the air expands, rises, and flows away
in the upper levels to oceans and flows in at the
bottom from the oceans; and thus are the Lows,
or centers of action, established on continents in
summer. It is apparent that these processes must
be reversed for the oceans, and that the Highs will
be found there in the summer and the Lows in the
winter. Carefully follow the illustrations of these
principles by examining the whole region north of
the equator on <a href="#i_ch1">Charts 1</a> and <a href="#i_ch2">2</a>.</p>

<p>In the Southern Hemisphere there is not such a
pronounced shifting of the Highs and the Lows from
oceans to continents and back again, with change in
the seasons, as there is in the Northern Hemisphere,
because of the small area of land in comparison with
that of water; but in the midst of the southern
summer, which occurs in January (<a href="#i_ch2">Chart 2</a>), Lows<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_194"></a>[194]</span>
are shown over South America, Africa, and Australia.
Note how the winds blow out of all the Highs and
into all the Lows. Also observe that the winds
generally blow from about latitude 30° north and
south towards the equator, due to the great heat
of the tropics, which causes the air to rise and in
the high levels to flow northward and southward,
settling down to the earth again through the belts
of high pressure that irregularly encircle the earth
at latitudes 30° north and south.</p>

<p>In the interior of continents the temperature
falls lower at night and rises higher during the day,
and falls lower in winter and rises higher in summer
than on any of their coasts. On the coast of central
California, for instance, the ocean is so cool in summer
and the winds blow so steadily from it that the
thermometer ranges between 55° and 70°, even when
there are temperatures of over 100° but a few hundred
miles away in the great interior valleys, or on the
broad plateaus of the mountains. New York and
Boston, in nearly the same latitude, also have their
summer temperatures modified by ocean influence,
but they are on the east side of a broad continent,
where the prevailing westerly winds give to them
more the character of a continental climate than
one marine; but occasionally the east wind, for a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_195"></a>[195]</span>
short time, gives to them the modifying influence
of the ocean. In the winter the influence of the
oceans is to modify the extremes of cold, the same
as they do the excessive heat of summer.</p>

and Asia) continent the difference between continental<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_196"></a>[196]</span>
and marine climates is more marked than in
the Western Hemisphere. Huntington and Cushing,
in their splendid work on <cite class="fsnormal">“Principles of Human
Geography”</cite>,<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> make a comparison between the southern
Lofoten Islands, off the coast of Norway, and
Verkhoyansk in Siberia, which probably furnish the
greatest contrast to be found anywhere between
places of the same latitude. Although both are
inside the Arctic Circle, the influence of the Atlantic
Ocean with its warm-water currents coming all the
way from the tropics (<a href="#i_ch13">Chart 13</a>) protects the Lofoten
Islands from the extreme cold that otherwise would
come to them; vegetation remains green and cattle
are pastured every month in the year. But the
ocean retains nearly the same temperature in summer
as in winter, and as a result the Islands are
too cold to grow trees or many crops. Verkhoyansk
is so different that one can scarcely believe that
both places are in the same latitude. At the Siberian
town the winter temperature falls to 70° or
80° below zero every winter, and has been known to
register 90° below zero. It is said that steel skates
often will not “take hold” but slip sideways as
well as forward on the surface of the excessively cold
ice. This doubtless is due to the fact that under<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_197"></a>[197]</span>
ordinary winter cold the weight of the skater melts
a thin film of water under the edge of the skate,
which freezes instantly when the skate passes and
relieves the pressure. But here the cold is so intense
that the weight of no skater is sufficient to
lubricate his movements with water molecules.
Remarkable to relate, the summer at Verkhoyansk
is warmer than in the islands off the Norwegian coast,
due to the rapidity with which the land surface warms
up under the action of the solar rays in the midst
of a continental area remote from water, 75° to 80°
frequently being recorded during the long summer
days. The ground never thaws for more than a
foot or so, but a number of crops are successfully
grown.</p>

<p>In the interior of a continent like that of Siberia
or of North America not only the changes from
season to season but from day to night are extreme;
while in mid-ocean the diurnal and the annual range
of temperature is small, day and night, winter and
summer being much the same. A place is influenced
by the ocean in proportion to its distance from the
sea, the presence or the absence of hills or mountains
between the place and the water, and by the fact
that the prevailing winds come from or go to the
ocean. Cities as far inland as Baltimore and Philadelphia<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_198"></a>[198]</span>
have their extremes of temperature somewhat
modified by the Atlantic Ocean, and if it were
not for the Coastal and the Sierra Nevada Mountains
the influence of the Pacific Ocean would be felt at
least as far inland as Denver, and the great Rocky
Mountain plateau would be one of the garden plots
of the world. The influence of the Pacific would
reach inland farther than now does the Atlantic
because of the prevailing westward drift of the
atmosphere in all middle latitudes.</p>

<p><b>Exaggeration of the Forest Influence on Climate.</b>
<a href="#CHAPTER_XIII">Chapter XIII</a>, on Change of Climate, shows more
in detail the process whereby the sun lifts up the
water vapor from the Gulf of Mexico and the Atlantic
Ocean and how cyclonic storms draw this
vaporous atmosphere northwestward far into the
interior of the continent, the Alleghany Mountains
not being high enough to offer serious obstruction.</p>

<p>The writer would again caution the reader not
to be misled by any pseudoscientist, no matter
how worthy his purpose may be, who would teach
that the operations of men in changing forest areas
to cultivated fields, gardens, villages, and cities, has
in the slightest degree harmfully affected the climate,
or augmented floods or intensified droughts. A
field of grass, of wheat, of corn; an orchard of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_199"></a>[199]</span>
fruit; a highway bordered with towering, majestic
oaks and elms; or a grove of cultivated trees about a
prosperous home is just as beneficial to the climate as
the thickest and most impenetrable forest and far
more pleasing to the eye and helpful to mankind.
Forests should be protected, conserved, and grown
because we need timber, not because a lot of foolish
people are writing nonsense about them.</p>

<p><b>Influence of Lakes and Rivers.</b> With the exception
of contributing to the formation of occasional
fogs over their surfaces and the adjacent low lands,
through the rising of warm water vapor into the
cold air that often collects at the bottom of valleys
during nighttime, rivers exercise little influence
on climate. Lakes exert a modifying influence on
the temperature of places near their shores but
only for a few miles therefrom, and they are too
small to exert any appreciable influence on rainfall.
If one examine charts showing the average rainfall
for the United States by seasons, he will
observe that the amount gradually shades off as
the distance from the Gulf or Ocean increases,
without any relation whatever to the five Great
Lakes. Deserts exist on either side of the Caspian
Sea, although it slightly increases the rain of the
Elburz Mountains to the south. If these great<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_200"></a>[200]</span>
bodies of water do not influence the rainfall, how
ridiculous to assume that the changing of forest
areas to other forms of vegetation possibly can
affect precipitation or influence droughts. Stress
is laid on the fact that some land is left bare and
then is eroded into deep gullies. This is true, but
the fault is one that may be corrected by a proper
system of plowing and cultivation. And at most
the area so eroded is so infinitesimal in comparison
to the vast regions changed from forests to growing
crops as to be negligible.</p>

<p><b>Influence of Ocean Currents on Climate.</b> Climates
are markedly influenced by the currents of oceans.
<a href="#i_ch15">Charts 15</a> and <a href="#i_ch16">16</a> show the normal wind circulations
of the globe; note that the centers of the great
swirls are coincident with the location of the High
and the Low centers of action located on <a href="#i_ch1">Charts 1</a>
and <a href="#i_ch2">2</a>. Next observe <a href="#i_ch13">Chart 13</a>, showing the ocean
currents, and it will be seen at once how closely the
circulation of the great ocean currents follows that
of the winds, due to the friction of the air upon the
water, and to the interposition of bodies of land
that turn about or deflect the currents.</p>

<p>Water has a greater capacity for heat than nearly
any other substance. It requires ten times the
quantity of heat to raise a pound of water one degree<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_201"></a>[201]</span>
that it does a pound of iron. The oceans
therefore store up vast quantities of the heat of the
sun and, unlike the continents, distribute this heat
northward and southward without regard to latitude.
Much of the heat of the tropics is thus transported
far northward and southward from the
equator. The extensive eddy-like circulation of
the south half of the North Atlantic Ocean sends
currents northward along the coast of the United
States which set eastward at latitude 40°. A part
of these reach the coast of Spain and then turn
south; the greater part spread out in mid-ocean and
move northeast, bathing the coasts of the British
Islands, Iceland, and Norway. They still retain
some of the heat that they absorbed from a tropical
sun, and they therefore give to the coasts that they
reach a higher temperature than they would have
if the ocean waters were moving from the north, or
than they would have if there were no currents at
all. On <a href="#i_ch14">Chart 14</a> note how the isothermal lines
are carried northward by these currents as they
cross the Atlantic Ocean. The Gulf Stream mingles
with these northeast currents but adds little to
their temperatures, for the general ocean circulation
would produce practically the same effects if
there were no Gulf Stream.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_202"></a>[202]</span></p>

<p>Follow the currents down the coast of Spain and
of northeast Africa; then note on <a href="#i_ch14">Chart 14</a> the
southward trend of the lines of equal temperature,
as the currents bring colder water southward to
cool the air. Next examine the currents of the
Pacific and the isothermals. The currents moving
northward towards the equator along the west
coast of South America, and those moving southward,
also toward the equator, along the west coast
of the United States and Mexico cause a bulging
of the isothermal lines from the positions that they
would occupy if there were no currents coming from
colder regions.</p>

<p><b>Influence of the Gulf Stream on Climate.</b> From
either side of the equator the surface winds (<a href="#i_ch15">Charts
15</a> and <a href="#i_ch16">16</a>) blow the water westward, causing what
are known as the “Equatorial Currents” (<a href="#i_ch13">Chart 13</a>).
The eastward projection of the coast of South
America divides the Atlantic equatorial current
into two parts; one goes south along the coast of
South America and sets up the circulation in the
South Atlantic, which sweeps north along the southwest
coast of Africa. The other passes to the
northwest, a part setting up the North Atlantic
circulation and the remainder sweeping through the
Windward Islands and storing itself in the Gulf<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_203"></a>[203]</span>
of Mexico, whence it is driven out at a velocity of
some five miles per hour through the narrow channel
between Key West and Cuba. Here it has a depth
of half a mile and a width of forty miles. Its velocity
is accelerated because it enters the Gulf in a
broad sweep and passes out through a constricted
channel. It retains its individuality as a warm
river passing through the ocean because of its greater
velocity and higher temperature than the waters
in which it finds itself soon after it leaves the Gulf;
but it gradually merges with the great Atlantic
circulation as it passes to the middle of the ocean.
It is the opinion of the writer that its influence on
climate has been exaggerated, that the warming
of Europe that is credited to the Gulf Stream
is accomplished by the mere presence of the ocean
to the westward and to the general circulation of
that ocean without regard to the wonderful phenomenon
known as the Gulf Stream.</p>

<p><b>Effect of Valleys on Day and Night Temperatures.</b>
Valleys affect temperatures in proportion to their
depth and width. A deep, narrow valley might
have the effect illustrated by <a href="#i_fig27">Figure 27</a>, if the time
were summer and the sky clear. During the daytime
radiation would warm the interior so that the
bottom of the valley would have a much higher<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_204"></a>[204]</span>
temperature than the free air at the top of the valley,
and the movement of the air would be sluggishly
down the center and up the sides of the depression.
During nighttime all the conditions would be reversed.
Vegetation, losing heat by radiation much
faster than the air, would cool the latter as it came
in contact with the sides of the valley. The air
would slowly descend along the sides through gain
in specific gravity and collect at the bottom with
a temperature much lower than it had when it
started its descent.</p>

<p><b>Effect of Mountains on Climate.</b> The rarity of
the atmosphere of mountains readily allows the
rays of the sun to pass through it and thus the surface<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_205"></a>[205]</span>
of mountains is quickly warmed, but the same
conditions permit a rapid radiation at night, so that
there are considerable extremes of temperature.
Air cooled by contact with a mountain may flow down
its sides at night and collect in depressions below,
often causing frost on still nights where the temperature
higher up is much above freezing. Mountains
may be more cloudy and rainy than plains,
for the currents of air that cross them must rise,
and in rising they cool by expansion and often reach
the dew point of the air, moisture being precipitated
in the form of clouds, rain, or snow. Often a peak
is constantly capped with a crown of clouds. Mountains
may intercept vapor-bearing winds from oceans,
force them to such an elevation that their vapor is
largely precipitated on the windward side of the
mountain, and receive them on the leeward side
as dry, rainless winds. Vast desert areas are often
the result. A good example is presented in the case
of the Pacific coast mountains and the desert plateau
to the east.</p>

<p>Mountain peaks may be covered with snow, even
though they be located in the tropics, if their elevation
be sufficient. This is because the absorption of
both incoming and outgoing radiation is so much
greater in the lower reaches of the atmosphere,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_206"></a>[206]</span>
where the water vapor is densest. Wherever observations
have been made they have shown that
the temperature of the air on high mountain peaks
and crests and for a distance of one to three hundred
feet above them is cooler than adjacent free air of
the same height, due to upward deflection of air
currents and their cooling by expansion, and to
radiation from the peak.</p>

<p>The Himalayan Mountains exercise a profound
effect on the climate of Asia. The monsoon (any
wind that alternates annually in direction or force)
of summer brings the moist air from the Bay of
Bengal and precipitates torrential rains from it as it
ascends to higher and higher elevations in passing
over the great heights of the mountains. At a
place four thousand feet above the sea and not
distant from Calcutta, the annual rainfall is 466
inches, while the average for most of the region east
of the Mississippi River is only forty inches. More
than forty inches have been known to fall in one day
in the Himalayan Mountains. As in the case of
all very high mountains, the rainfall increases in
these mountains up to a certain elevation and then
decreases. North of the mountains the monsoon
passes into the interior of Asia with withering dryness
and vast deserts are the result.</p>

temperature and rainfall of typical places in North<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_208"></a>[208]</span>
America, and <a href="#i_fig29">Figure 29</a> of places in the Old World.
Here may be seen every phase of climate from tropical<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_209"></a>[209]</span>
to temperate and to cold, and from marine to
continental. By studying the winds on <a href="#i_ch15">Charts 15</a>
and <a href="#i_ch16">16</a> and the ocean currents on <a href="#i_ch13">Chart 13</a>, the
reader should be able to find an explanation for the
different conditions shown. For example: Mazatlan
and Vera Cruz are both on the coast of Mexico,
the first on the west and the latter on the east.
Each has a rainy period in the summer, but at Vera
Cruz the rain begins earlier and lasts later and is
much heavier. The reason is that they both have
north winds in winter (<a href="#i_ch15">Charts 15</a> and <a href="#i_ch16">16</a>), but in
summer Vera Cruz receives winds direct from the
Gulf of Mexico and at Mazatlan the winds continue
to blow from the north, with but a slight inclination
landward. Again, the explanation for the fact that
Mazatlan has a monthly range of temperature from
60° in winter to 80° in summer, while Vera Cruz
has a range of only 70° to 80° is found in the wind
direction.</p>

</figure>

<p>The City of Mexico is wonderfully favored by
climate. Here a moderate rainfall occurs from
May to September. The oceans are not far distant
on either side, as distances are measured continentally,
but its great elevation on a table-land relieves
it of the torrential rains usual to the tropics; and
yet it is close enough to marine influence so that its<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_210"></a>[210]</span>
air has not the nerve-irritating dryness of the plateau
of the Rocky Mountains, and it has a remarkable
evenness of temperature between winter and summer,
with a monthly range between 50° and 60°. Its
range between day and night is sufficient to be
stimulating.</p>

<p>Still looking at <a href="#i_fig28">Figure 28</a>, note the remarkable
similarity between the climate <ins class="corr" id="tn-210" title="Transcriber’s Note—Original text: 'of Pittsburg and'">
of Pittsburgh and</ins>
Toronto. Each has about the same rainfall and it
is almost equally distributed throughout the months
of the year. The only difference is that Toronto
is a little colder. St. Paul and Kansas City, typical
of the climate in the interior cities, have a small
amount of precipitation in winter, considerable in
summer, and a wide range of temperature; while
the Pacific coast cities have dry summers, and winters
that vary from three inches of rain at Los Angeles
to fourteen inches at Astoria, with no excesses in
temperature.</p>

<p><b>Temperatures Aloft in the Atmosphere.</b> Kite
and balloon observations have not been continued
long enough, nor have they been made at a sufficient
number of places, to give one the data from which
the climate of any considerable altitude in the free
air may be determined, but from a large number of
free balloon observations made with self-recording<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_211"></a>[211]</span>
instruments, in the middle latitudes of this and
foreign countries, <a href="#i_fig1">Figure 1</a> (page 12) has been
constructed, which shows the manner in which the
temperature decreases with elevation up to eighteen
kilometers (eleven miles). Note how rapidly it falls
with elevation up to eleven and a half kilometers
(about seven miles). This depth of air measures
the thickness of the turbulent stratum in which
cyclones and anti-cyclones operate. At its top the
temperature always is about 64° below zero in winter
and 70° below in summer. And right here occurs
a most wonderful phenomenon,—one of which
scientists were entirely ignorant less than two
decades ago. At first it was thought that there
was something wrong with the recording thermometers,
for they failed to register falling temperature
with gaining altitude after the storm stratum
was passed at seven miles. Then it was noted that
all instruments displayed the same peculiarity, and
the “Isothermal Stratum” (equally heated region)
was discovered, in which the temperature maintains
the same degree of intense cold so far as exploration
had been made. From Mount Weather, under the
direction of the writer, a balloon was flown to nineteen
and one tenth miles before it exploded and sent
a parachute gently down to earth with its precious<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_212"></a>[212]</span>
record. This flight showed practically no change in
temperature after the isothermal stratum was
reached. (See <a href="#CHAPTER_III">Chapter III</a>.) One is reasonably
safe in assuming that there is no oxygen beyond an
altitude of thirty miles and that at fifty miles the
nitrogen becomes inappreciable, and that, therefore,
the temperature must shade away to practically
nothing when the void of outer space is reached,
notwithstanding the presence of the newly-discovered
isothermal stratum nearer the earth.</p>

CIVILIZATION FOLLOWS THE STORM TRACKS</h2>

<p class="p1b negin2">THE MOST DOMINANT RACES—THOSE THAT BEST CO-ORDINATE
THE MENTAL AND PHYSICAL FACULTIES—ARE
FOUND TO EXIST UNDER CERTAIN CLIMATIC
CONDITIONS—CHANGE THE CLIMATE AND YOU
CHANGE THE MAN</p>


<p>In a climate where man needs little protection
from the elements, where he may lie upon his back
in the shade and with his bare toes pick wild growing
fruit to nourish his body, one will find no great
leaders in art, literature, science, statecraft, or
industry; likewise, in the Arctic, where man simply
gathers enough blubber to supply his animal wants
and then burrows beneath the snows of fierce winters,
one will not find leadership or creative genius. The
regions of greatest human potential are limited to
such portions of the temperate zone as have an
abundance of rainfall, frequent changes in the
weather, and an alluvial soil. In other words, the
most perfect composite of human resourcefulness<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_214"></a>[214]</span>
is found where nature is neither so fierce as to crush
human aspiration, nor yet so gentle as to lull human
desire.</p>

<p><ins class="corr" id="tn-214" title="Transcriber’s Note—Original text: 'Humbolt says'">
Humboldt says</ins>: “Man is the product of soil
and climate; he is brother to the tree, the rocks,
and the animals.” We shall endeavor to show that
civilization and the greatest human potential follow
the storm tracks of the world, and that climate is the
most important factor in his environment, for without
its proper adjustment to his needs the richest
soil and the most beneficent form of government
fail to bring out the best that is in him. Empire
is determined as much by direction and force of the
wind and changes in the weather as by the scheming
of politicians, the deep-laid plans of diplomats, or
the marshaling of battalions.</p>

<p>The first thing that vigorous man requires is
active atmospheric conditions and in his migrations
he follows the climatic lines that appease his desires.
A climate of little change between day and night
and between winter and summer is soothing and at
the same time deadening to the human faculties;
but changes should be frequent rather than violent.
The daring, the creative, the pioneering, the persistent
spirits of mankind, like snow birds showering
themselves with icy crystals, revel in the cool air,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_215"></a>[215]</span>
the perpetual oscillations of temperature, and the
frequent changes from sunshine to cloud that pertain
to the regions where storms are most numerous.</p>

<p>Some days the mind works with a joyous lucidity,
the spirits are high and the step elastic and vigorous.
On another day the mind is turbid; it works slowly
and hesitates in reaching decisions; one is listless
and lacking in physical energy. On both days one
may be in a perfectly normal physical and mental
condition, except for the effects of the weather.</p>

<p>Under the direction of the writer, comparison of
the records of crimes of violence with the weather
records, by officials of the U. S. Weather Bureau,
showed a marked increase of crime of this sort during
midsummer as against midwinter, and the extremely
hot summer showed more crime than the cool ones.
During recent years Ellsworth Huntington has
made exhaustive and extremely valuable studies
of the records of piece workers in factories and
elsewhere from New England and the Middle Atlantic
States down to Florida and the Gulf of Mexico,
and also of the mental activities of the cadets at
West Point and Annapolis, and of the students in
colleges, as shown by their recitation markings.<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_216"></a>[216]</span>
He has compared these records with the weather day
by day and hour by hour and definitely shown
a direct relation between variations in the meteorological
conditions and human efficiency. He finds
that people’s health and strength are greatest
when the temperature falls to between 56° and 60°
at night and rises to somewhere between 68° and
72° during the day. He has determined the optimum,
or, in other words, the meteorological conditions
best suited to man’s health, happiness, and
efficiency. For mental activity the optimum temperature
is much lower than for physical. People’s
minds are more alert, they reason with greater
analytic precision, they have greater confidence in
their decisions and they are more optimistic, when
the temperature falls to about freezing at night
and rises to 45° or 50° during the day. Except for
limited activities, the most efficient man is the one
in whom the mental and physical faculties are most
perfectly coördinated. Broadly speaking, this agreement
may be best accomplished during times when
the daily temperature ranges between 45° and 65°.</p>

<p>Excessive humidity in midsummer—eighty per
cent. or over—is harmful and adds enormously
to the death rate; on the other hand, some of the
worst colds may come from extreme dryness in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_217"></a>[217]</span>
summer. It may be found feasible to dry the air
in sleeping and living rooms in summer when the
humidity is too high, by closing the apartment and
forcing the air over or through calcium carbide or
melting ice and salt. When the air is kept at 65 to 70
per cent. humidity in winter one will feel comfortable
in a much lower temperature—about 68°—than
when the air is extremely dry, as it usually is in the
average living apartment. With a relative humidity
of 30 to 40 per cent. which one now often finds
in warm houses in winter, the temperature may
be forced up to 75° or over and still one may feel
cold, because of the rapid evaporation from the pores
of the skin, and the cold created inside the clothing
by the heat lost in the process of evaporation.
Bear in mind that perspiration is going on at all
temperatures, even if one is unconscious of the fact.</p>

<p>In the most populous portions of the United States
there are two periods of maximum efficiency and two
of minimum each year. Let us consider that wonderful
region including southern New England, the Middle
Atlantic States, the Ohio Valley, and westward
to the Rocky Mountains. Again referring to the
records of Huntington we find that human energy
is greatest in October; the output of factory, mine,
and counting room is greater per man than at any<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_218"></a>[218]</span>
other time of the year and the product of mental
effort is greater and of higher quality. Likewise
disease is less and the death rate the least. From
this time there is a loss in energy until January or
February, when vitality and efficiency may have
dropped twenty to thirty per cent. Then there is
a gain until May or early June, when the conditions
of health and efficiency are nearly equal to the most
favorable time of the year in October. Again there
is a loss until the middle of July, when a second
minimum occurs; physical and mental energy are
at a low ebb and the death rate is high. Diseases
are not quite the same as in winter, as stomach
troubles are more common than colds. The hotter
the summer and the colder the winter the less
favorable are the conditions of human existence.</p>

<p>As there is a certain optimum beyond which
diurnal and annual range of temperature cannot
increase without a loss in energy, so there is a limitation
in latitude beyond which the favorable
climatic conditions decrease as one goes northward
or southward. As an example, Canada and
northern Maine have but one unfavorable period,
which is the entire winter. The people of these
regions are at their greatest potential July to September,
after which they show a steady decline as the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_219"></a>[219]</span>
severity of the northern winter draws upon their
vitality, until in January and February their minimum
is below that of regions considerably farther
south for the same period.</p>

<p>From the most favorable climatic area in the
middle latitudes—and the entire world possesses
none more favorable or of greater extent than that
possessed by the United States—the loss of health
and strength due to the enervating effects of heat,
high humidity, and insufficient temperature oscillations
increases as one goes toward the equator.
In Florida and the southern third of the Gulf States
there is but one favorable period, the short winter.
The enervating conditions still further are manifest
as one proceeds farther southward.</p>

<p>In the <cite class="fsnormal">“Principles of Human Geography”</cite>, it is
stated that “in Central France and Southern Germany
the seasonal variations in health and strength are
much the same as in Boston, New York, Cleveland,
and Detroit. That is, people are most healthy and
strong in October and early November and again
in May and early June, while they are weakest and
most subject to disease in January, February, and
early March, and again in July and August. Farther
north, for example, in Scotland, Scandinavia, and
Finland, the summer is the best time of the whole<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_220"></a>[220]</span>
year and the winter the worst. To the south, on
the contrary, in Italy, Spain, and Greece, the harmful
effect of the winter decreases and that of summer
increases, until finally on the south side of the Mediterranean
the winter is much the best time of the
whole year, while the long summer greatly diminishes
the people’s efficiency and increases disease and
death.”</p>

<p>As the highest mental activity is coincident with
temperatures lower than those that induce the
greatest physical energy, it naturally follows that
in the Ohio Valley, southern New England, and the
Middle Atlantic States the mental worker is at
his maximum in November instead of October, and
April instead of May.</p>

</figure>

<p>From the time when man began to lose his tribal
instinct and to assume national consciousness, in
Egypt, the Mesopotamian Valley, and the region
between the Caspian Sea and the Persian Gulf, he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_221"></a>[221]</span>
has been founding empires of more or less enduring
nature, and with few exceptions has builded towards
the west, in the face of the prevailing winds. The
center of Empire has steadily migrated along the
paths of greatest storm frequency. Examine <a href="#i_ch10">Charts
10</a>, <a href="#i_ch11">11</a>, and <a href="#i_ch18">18</a> and note the relation between
density of population and the closeness of the storm
tracks. The figures at the center of each brace
indicate the number of storms that originated in the
region of the brace during a ten-year period, and
the lines leading from the brace show the tracks
followed by the centers of the storms. Bear in mind
that each storm covered an area of from five hundred
to one thousand miles in diameter, that it was a vast
rotating eddy in the atmosphere, and that its center<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_222"></a>[222]</span>
of rotation followed one of these storm tracks.
Twelve storms came from the West Indies during
these ten Augusts, fifty-seven from the Rocky
Mountains and none from the Pacific Ocean; while
in the ten Januaries none came from the West
Indies and but twenty-two from the Pacific Ocean.
But the point to which your attention is directed
is that, no matter what the origin, the tendency of
each storm was to move towards the Ohio Valley,
Pennsylvania, New York, New Jersey, and New
England. This tendency gives to these regions
the most frequent changes in weather, with alternations
of sunshine and clouds, and changes in temperature<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_223"></a>[223]</span>
and air pressure—conditions essential to
the development of the greatest human potential.
Here population is the densest, civilization the
highest, and the products of man’s brain and hand
greater and more diversified than elsewhere in
this country, and probably than elsewhere in the
world. The United States is abundantly blessed,
for nearly its entire area is under the influence of
high atmospheric potential. Only the region adjacent
to the Gulf of Mexico and the southwest is
outside of the favored area, and here the conditions
are charted as medium, and not poor; at least not
poor in comparison with many more purely tropical
regions.</p>

<p>To-day the Empire of Human Greatness is centered
over the United States, that is to say, greatness
as expressed in material wealth, population,
and homogeneously knit political institutions. Will
it continue its westward migration, or will it remain
here indefinitely for the working out of a civilization
higher than yet has come to any of the nations of
the past, or to other of those of the present? So far
as atmospheric activities have to do with its translation
from place to place, we may derive comfort from
the fact that storm tracks do not cross the Pacific
Ocean as freely as they do the Atlantic. In fact our<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_224"></a>[224]</span>
Rocky Mountains are a barrier to the passage of
summer storms (<a href="#i_ch10">Chart 10</a>) and a reference to <a href="#i_ch11">Chart 11</a>
will show that of ninety-five winter storms that
crossed our continent during the ten Januaries of
which the chart is a record only twenty-two came
into our area from the Pacific; and we know that
these twenty-two largely originated off our coast
somewhere between Hawaii and the Aleutian Islands.
Let us hope that the center of earthly power has
reached the end of its westward journey and that
here it shall remain, always to exercise a just and
beneficent influence upon the less favored portions
of the earth.</p>

<p>Enough has been said to indicate that climate is
nearly as important to animal life as it is to the
vegetable existence, and that a cold climate, if it be
not so extreme as to limit the production of cereal
crops, and has frequent changes in temperature,
pressure, sunshine, and cloud, favors the development
of hardy and resourceful races of men; in fact, that
no dominating race can exist without such stimulating
conditions of climate.</p>

HAS OUR CLIMATE CHANGED?</h2>

<p class="p1b negin2">POPULAR OPINION ERRONEOUS, AS THERE IS NO CHANGE
WITHIN THE PERIOD OF AN INDIVIDUAL LIFE, BUT
MOMENTOUS CHANGES HAVE OCCURRED SINCE THE
BEGINNING OF THE CHRISTIAN ERA</p>


<p>One of the hallucinations entertained by nearly
every adult person is that the climate has changed
since he was young. No matter what the scientists
may say, he knows that it has changed. Fifty years
ago did he not trudge to school for months every
winter in snow knee-deep? Have not the old
swimming holes in the brook dried up? Yes, he
is a positive witness to an affirmative answer. Even
the river of his boyhood, whose broad expanse he
conquered in a swimming contest at the tender
age of ten—as he views it after an absence of a
quarter-century—has dwindled to little more than
a creek, across which one easily may hurl a stone.
Talk to him about no change in climate. He’s
been right on the spot, and knows. For all this, there<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_226"></a>[226]</span>
has been no change during the lifetime of this man;
nor has there ever been during the life period of any
individual. Mutations, to be sure, are going on all
the time, but they are so minute that they do
not accumulate a measurable quantity except in
periods of hundreds or thousands of years. It is
not the climate that has changed; it is the man.
The natural action of the stream may have filled the
swimming holes; or the stream may have entirely
disappeared through much of the contiguous area
being brought under cultivation and the water that
formerly supplied its flow being utilized in the
production of cultivated crops, which actually make
use of as much if not more rainfall than the forest
that formerly lined its sinuous banks and covered
the near-by lowland. And then, snow knee-deep
to a boy of ten hardly comes up to the ankles of a
man of six feet two. Again, no one can remember
the climate of his boyhood; he cannot carry the
average in his mind; all that he can remember are
a few instances of unusual conditions which because
of their unusual character left an impress upon his
mind. The river is just as wide as it ever was
during the period of his lifetime, or that of his father,
or of his grandfather; but he has lived on the broad
Mississippi for many years, and when he goes back<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_227"></a>[227]</span>
to the scenes of his youth, his concept of what
constitutes a river has undergone a revolutionary
change since he left the parental roof to go forth
and conquer the world.</p>

<p>An examination of the personal papers of Thomas
Jefferson, in the State Department at Washington,
by an official of the Weather Bureau, revealed a
number of most interesting incidents in connection
with the weather observations made by the author
of the Declaration of American Independence. He
says:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“A change in climate is taking place very sensibly.
Both heats and colds are becoming much more
moderate within the memory of even the middle-aged.
Snows are less frequent and less deep. They
do not often lie below the mountains more than one,
two, or three days, and very rarely a week. The
snows are remembered to have been more frequent,
deep, and of long continuance. The elderly inform
me that the earth used to be covered with snow
about three months in every year.”</p>
</div>

<p>But Jefferson and his neighbors were mistaken.
Never during the period of authentic history has
the snow covered the ground in Virginia an average
of three months per year, or three months for a
single year. These old inhabitants were like those
of to-day, who remember only the abnormalities<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_228"></a>[228]</span>
of climate of twenty-five or fifty years ago, and
in comparing the unusual conditions of long ago
with the average of the present time they are deceived.
I have known intelligent and well-meaning
persons to declare that they knew from personal
recollection that the climate of their particular
places of residence had changed since they were
young; that they had stable landmarks to show
that the streams were drying up, the rainfall growing
less, and the winters becoming milder, notwithstanding
the fact that carefully taken observations
of temperature and rainfall for each day for over
one hundred years right at their places of abode
showed no change in climate. We have a continuous
daily record for one hundred years at New Bedford,
Massachusetts, nearly as long records at several
other places, and numerous records for over half a
century. From these we learn that there has been
no definite change in climate in this country during
the past hundred years. There have been variations,
such as an excess or a deficiency of rainfall over a
considerable area, that have persisted for several
years at a time; but in each case the conditions
would ultimately come back to normal, or more
often to an extreme of the opposite tendency to what
had obtained immediately before. In sections where<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_229"></a>[229]</span>
the rainfall in bountiful years is barely sufficient
for good crops, the people in the past have been
prone to consider that the amount that they receive
during the periods of excess is that which normally
is due them, and thus to be unprepared for
the dry periods that statistics tell us must certainly
come. The matter of change of climate is most
important to our sub-arid West,—to the western
parts of Texas, Oklahoma, Kansas, Nebraska, and
the Dakotas. Some years ago, when the tide of
emigration was strong into these regions, there were
several years of more than the average rainfall. The
coming of population and the coming of extra rainfall
were accidentally coincident, but that fact was
probably responsible for the popular belief that
civilization brings an increase in precipitation; that
the breaking of the virgin soil, making it more permeable
to the absorption of moisture; the planting
of trees and the growth of crops, restricting the
run-off; the roots of the new vegetable life drawing
up the moisture from below the surface of the ground
and transpiring it to the air through the leaves of
plants; the enormous quantities of water vapor
ejected into the air by the combustion necessarily
incident to a considerable population,—all had
combined to increase the rainfall and render the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_230"></a>[230]</span>
sub-arid plains more responsive to the efforts of
the husbandman. No one can fail to regret that
this theory is not founded upon fact. But a moment’s
thought by the scientist will indicate to him
that the volume of air is so great, and under the
heat of the growing period its capacity for moisture
so enormous, that the addition of vapor of water by
the processes herein described, great though it be,
is ineffectual to appreciably change the amount of
the rainfall that nature beforehand had ordained
should be precipitated.</p>

<p>The size of continental areas, the height and the
trend of mountain ranges, the proximity of large
bodies of water, and the direction of the prevailing
winds are the factors that determine the amount
of the precipitation of a region. Against these the
puny efforts of man, stupendous though we think
them to be, are entirely unavailing. As an illustration:
If the Rocky Mountains were as old as the
Appalachian Chain, and if they were eroded down to
the height of the latter system, the winds from the
Pacific Ocean, when they are drawn inland by the
cyclonic storms of the Rocky Mountain plateau, or
of the Mississippi Valley, instead of depositing their
moisture on the west slopes of the first range of
mountains, would carry the water vapor of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_231"></a>[231]</span>
Pacific clear to that place in the Mississippi Valley
where it would meet the moisture drawn by the same
storms from the Gulf of Mexico and the Atlantic
Ocean. This will appear clear when one understands
that cyclonic storms, such as are continually
passing across our continent in periods of about
three days each, may embrace in their eddy-like
circulating systems areas one to three thousand
miles in diameter, in which the winds from all directions
spirally flow towards the center of the
cyclonic system and the system itself is moving
eastward.</p>

<p>The water vapor exists as a separate atmosphere
from oxygen and nitrogen. It is screened off from
the interior of continents by mountain ranges because
it is condensed and precipitated as rain or
snow at only moderate elevations. The windward
side of mountains may, therefore, receive torrential
rains while their leeward sides are entirely without
precipitation.</p>

<p>It follows that if the Rocky Mountains were lowered
as described, the entire United States would
be green with rich vegetation and there would be no
deserts anywhere within its broad boundaries.
Also, if the Appalachian Range were as high as the
Rocky Mountains—as it may have been at one<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_232"></a>[232]</span>
time—and if it extended around the Gulf of Mexico
as well as up through our Atlantic Coast States, the
vaporous atmosphere of the Atlantic Ocean and of
the Gulf of Mexico would be prevented from entering
the interior of the continent, and the power
that to-day stands as the greatest bulwark of civilization
would not exist. There would be but a
narrow fringe of vegetation upon its east and its
west coasts; the interior, with its vast cotton and
cereal plains, would be a barren waste.</p>

<p>But to revert for a moment to Jefferson. He
took his thermometer to Philadelphia when he
proceeded there on a mission that would have caused
any less serene and courageous spirit to forget all
the small details of life. When the debates upon
which hung the fate of a nation and, in fact, the
lives of those that participated, were in progress, he
coolly hung his thermometer on the wall and noted
down its readings. Those historians who have
described the intense heat in Independence Hall
on the Fourth of July, 1776, were mistaken, as will
be shown by reference to his observations, the
early and the late ones of which doubtless were made
at his lodgings. They are as follows: 6 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span>, 68°;
9 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span>, 72¼°; 1 <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span>, 76°; and 9 <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span>, 73½°.</p>

<p>Jefferson had one of the only two barometers in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_233"></a>[233]</span>
this country at that time. James Madison (the
Bishop, not the President) had the other. They
took readings at the same hour of the day for a considerable
period of time, and Jefferson discovered
that changes in the pressure of the air always began
on his instrument a few hours before they did on
his friend’s instrument a couple of hundred miles to
the east of him. He came near discovering the
fact that no matter what the direction of the wind,
storms almost universally move from the west
toward the east. When the British captured Washington
they also raided Monticello, Jefferson’s home
in Virginia, and they destroyed his barometer. It
has been said that he was as much distressed over
the loss of his special instrument of science as he
was over the burning of the National Capitol.</p>

<p>In <cite class="fsnormal">“Descriptive Meteorology”</cite> (Appleton), the
writer expressed doubt that there had been important
changes in climate within the period of authentic
history, but recent researches cause him to change
his opinion, for the evidence now seems almost
conclusive that marked changes have occurred. The
powerful kingdoms of Sumeria, Babylonia, Assyria,
and Persia, each ruling many centuries and dominating
all or a large part of the vast region from the
Persian Gulf to the Caspian Sea and westward to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_234"></a>[234]</span>
the Mediterranean and Egypt, covering in their
various reigns some four thousand years before Christ,
could hardly have built their many great cities,
supported their numerous millions of population,
and developed the trade and commerce that was
theirs with the climatic conditions as they exist
to-day. As late as the opening of the Christian
Era, Palmyra, in Syria, had a population of from one
hundred and fifty thousand to two hundred thousand
people, was opulent and adorned with a comparatively
high civilization. To-day we see the wreckage
of its vast aqueduct and irrigating systems,
which are unable to gather enough water to wet
their well-constructed walls, and a few hundred
people eke out a miserable existence where once
was a metropolis teeming with life under luxurious
conditions. The same picture is shown in more or
less relief throughout the greater part of the region
that once maintained the greatest empires of antiquity.
But we must not assume that such dry and
nearly barren conditions are to continue forever;
rather are we to imagine that within a cycle of a few
thousand years this region may have a rebirth of
abundant vegetation and again throb with the
pulsations of abounding life.</p>

<p>The record inscribed by the waters on the abandoned<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_235"></a>[235]</span>
and the submerged shores of inland lakes
and seas in the Rocky Mountains, and on the shores
of the Caspian Sea and other waters, is easy to read.
It shows several great oscillations of climate in the
United States and the most civilized portions of
the world since the birth of Christ. For some
time before and for several centuries after the beginning
of our era there was a wet period. The Caspian
Sea stood some one hundred feet higher than now
and an abandoned beach and a clearly marked
shore line show that Lake Owens, in California, on
the east side of the Sierras, existed at a level nearly
two hundred feet higher than now. There was an
abundance of water to irrigate the Holy Land, and
although the center of dominating human power
had long since passed in succession Babylon, Assyria,
Persia, Greece, Macedon, and was working its way
towards the Atlantic, the Mesopotamian Valley was
abundantly fruitful.</p>

<p>Then, for six or seven hundred years, with short-period
variations of from thirty to fifty years, the
world inhabited by civilized man and large areas
in the temperate zone not yet civilized, grew drier.
The Caspian Sea fell to a lower level than it now
maintains, for the ends of great walls, constructed
to keep out barbarians, and other evidences of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_236"></a>[236]</span>
handiwork of man, are now many feet below the
surface of the water. This is the driest time known
to history. Ellsworth Huntington of Yale, acting
under the auspices of the Carnegie Foundation at
Washington, made an examination of many of the
stumps of the big trees of California, ranging in age
from one to four thousand years. The thickness
of each ring of annual growth is a legible record of
the wetness or the dryness of the year. One would
hardly think of these towering giants of the floral
kingdom as being both thermometers and rain
gauges, accurately measuring and recording the
dry-hot and the wet-cold periods for thousands of
years, and now at the end of their majestic careers
revealing the hidden secrets of past ages. Huntington
and Cushing, in <cite class="fsnormal">“Principles of Human Geography”</cite>,
say:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The rings dating from the time of Christ are
thick and indicate that at that time, when Palmyra
had an abundant supply of water, when Owens
Lake overflowed and there was high water in the
Caspian Sea, the big trees also had plenty of water
and grew rapidly. Six or seven hundred years
later, when Palmyra was abandoned and when the
Caspian Sea stood fifteen or twenty feet lower than
at present, the trees formed only narrow rings,
because the climate was dry. The way in which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_237"></a>[237]</span>
the growth of the trees has varied is shown in <a href="#i_fig30">Figure
30</a>. The high part of the curve indicates abundant
rainfall. The black shading at the bottom indicates
periods of comparative aridity.”</p>
</div>

  <figcaption class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 30.</span>—Changes in Climate in California during the Christian Era.
Black shading indicates Drought.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Since the extensive system of observations by the
Weather Bureau was inaugurated, some fifty years
ago, it has been revealed to us that frequently the
Ohio Valley would suffer a deficit in rainfall that
would persist for periods as great as five or six years,
while New England and the South Atlantic States,
or other large areas of the country, had an excess.
This is an illustration that excesses in one part of the
country were balanced by shortages in other parts
that occurred at the same time. But the long-period
oscillations in climate that are measured in
hundreds of years instead of tens—these changes
seemed to have occurred simultaneously in the
middle latitudes of Europe and America. These
changes were simultaneous in an east and west
direction. Now we have evidence of such long-period<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_238"></a>[238]</span>
changes in a north and south direction which were
simultaneous, but of an <em>opposite character</em>, indicating
that during the Christian Era the eastward track of
storms has oscillated northward and southward.
This would account for the occurrence of dry and of
wet periods simultaneously throughout the vast
stretch of territory between southern California and
the Caspian Sea. In Guatemala, Yucatan, and other
Central American countries there are ruins of cities
and the evidence of an agriculture and a civilization
that could not have been established with the
torrential rains and jungle growths that now prevail
in those regions. During the centuries when the
big trees of California were receiving a large rainfall
and making a thick annual growth, especially about
the beginning of the Christian Era, because of a
northward shifting of the climatic zone, the precipitation
in Yucatan and Guatemala had so diminished
as to leave only the amount of rainfall that could be
economically employed in agriculture and in the
rearing of great cities; and then, with a southward
migration of the rain belt, these cities were suffocated
with excessive precipitation, agriculture rendered
impossible, and their temples and palaces buried
beneath the gloom of a tropical growth.</p>

<p>If we are to reason from the records of the past<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_239"></a>[239]</span>
it seems highly probable that at least the middle
latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere are slowly
passing out of a dry period that has prevailed for
the past two hundred years or more. For several
hundred years all the great glaciers have receded,
but we should not expect such recession to continue
indefinitely. Geology furnishes abundant evidence
that great changes took place in the climate of the
earth during the prehistoric ages; that there were
several glacial periods, the last occurring during
pleistocene times, somewhere between twenty and
fifty thousand years ago, and that there were intervals
between the culminations of the Ice Ages of probably
fifty thousand to one hundred thousand years.
Between these long winters, that have meant death
and desolation to much of what are now the most
civilized portions of the earth, there have been warm
periods of thousands of years’ duration.</p>

<p>Fossil remains show that regions far north, now
covered with perpetual ice, once supported a luxuriant
flora and fauna, and many regions in the temperate
and equatorial zones that are now deserts
were once overgrown with forests and teeming
with animal life. The fundamental thing of the
cosmos is change—birth, growth, maturity; then
decline, senility, death, decay, disintegration; and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_240"></a>[240]</span>
always a renaissance, or new birth. Energy and
life seem to be eternal, but ever undergoing change.
The Great Ice Cap may again cover New England,
the region of the Great Lakes, and flow southward
to the Ohio River, but the change will be so gradual,
if it does come, that there will be no great cities to
be ground beneath the feet of the boreal monster;
cold that will precede the ice cap will destroy them
and they will be buried beneath the dust of accumulating
ages before their icy tombstone is erected.
Then the healthful and invigorating climate of the
north part of our country will be transferred to the
region of the Gulf of Mexico. Civilization will and
must migrate with the shifting of the climatic belts.
Because these changes cannot possibly concern us
personally, we have almost neglected the study of
the great forces that silently yet most persistently
are at work altering the conditions under which
future man must live and work out the destiny of
coming generations.</p>

<p><b>Effects of Forests on Climate and Floods.</b> Next to
the fallacious belief in a change of climate during
the life of an individual there are few if any errors
that have gained such wide acceptance as a belief that
the cutting away of the forests has caused a marked
change in climate and especially in the frequency<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_241"></a>[241]</span>
and intensity of floods and droughts. The writer
shared in the mistake with regard to the influence
of the forests in restraining run-off and augmenting
floods, until compelled by an order of the Congress
of the United States to prepare a report on the floods
of the nation that had occurred during the time of
the gradual reduction of the forest areas. Dividing
into two equal periods the forty years for which
the Weather Bureau has comprehensive records of
the rainfall upon the catchment basins of the Tennessee,
the Cumberland, and the Ohio rivers, and
for which it has records of the height of the rivers,
contrary to his belief, he found that the high waters
were no higher with a given rainfall, the floods of
no longer duration, nor the low waters of summer
lower, during the last half of the period than during
the first half.</p>

<p>It is now pretty generally conceded by hydraulic
engineers that the broken, permeable soil of the
husbandman, frequently stirred by cultivation a
part of the year and filled with countless billions of
the tiny water-absorbing rootlets of the grasses
and the cereal crops during the remainder of the
annual period, is equally as good a conserver of the
rainfall as the forests themselves, even if it is not
better.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_242"></a>[242]</span></p>

<p>Some years ago the writer was delivering a series
of Chautauqua lectures. He arrived at Devil’s
Lake, North Dakota, and found that the Chautauqua
amphitheater was on the banks of Devil’s Lake,
once bordering the town, but now receded to a distance
of five miles and confined to a narrow valley.
In driving from the city to the lecture hall he remarked
to his escort that they seemed to be traveling
along the bottom of an ancient lake. His companion
said, “Yes, a lake, but not an ancient one.
Fifty years ago I used to dive off a springboard right
there in front of the railroad station.” In the
course of his lecture the writer referred to this incident
and told them that, contrary to their belief,
their climate had not changed, that fifty years ago
they sold their old lake to some gentlemen in Chicago
and that they had been selling it over again every
year since; that the former compact surface of the
virgin prairie resisted the penetration of the rainfall,
or at least only slowly absorbed it, and allowed
it to collect in the depression adjacent to the city;
but now, in the broken, permeable soil of the farmer
it was taken up by millions of tiny rootlets and the
hand of the Great Alchemist had transformed their
lake into wheat, the sale of which was responsible
for the presence of the speaker on the platform of a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_243"></a>[243]</span>
largely-attended Chautauqua. The lake had gone
never to return unless the region were again to become
the haunt of the buffalo and the prairie dog
instead of civilized man. The rainfall was the same,
but it was now being utilized for the benefit of mankind.</p>

<p>In this problem of rainfall, floods, and the forests,
most persons assume that when the forest is cut
the land is at once denuded of vegetation. On the
other hand a second growth will effectually shade
the soil within a few months or a few weeks after
the large trees are removed, and if the land is cleared
and rendered fit for the plow, growing crops take
the place of the forest-covering the greater portion
of the time.</p>

<p>There is an abundance of reasons for the protection
of our diminishing forests and for the creation of
new forest areas without assigning to the forests
functions that they do not exercise. The covering
of an area by a great city, a village, a forest, a barn,
or a tent modifies the climate of the particular area
covered so long as the covering remains, but there is
no appreciable climatic effect a few feet above the
surface of the earth between a forest and a field of
grain. The climate of a region like the American
continent is controlled fundamentally by the great<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_244"></a>[244]</span>
oceans that wash its shores, by the trend of its mountain
systems and their height, and by the direction
of its prevailing winds. The vast vaporous atmosphere
that flows inland from the Atlantic Ocean
to the foothills of the Rocky Mountains, deluging
our cereal plains with its life-giving precipitation
will continue its pluvial generosity without any heed
whatever to the puny scratchings of man upon the
surface of Mother Earth. Nothing that man can
do will intensify drought conditions on this continent
or augment the volume of floods. It is time
that we return to sanity in considering this matter
instead of being frightened by the dire forebodings
of well-meaning but purely visionary enthusiasts, no
matter how noble their aspirations may be or how
self-sacrificingly they have consecrated themselves
to the redemption of humanity.</p>

<p>It is certain that forests restrict the flow of moderate
falls of rain, but they do not restrain the flow of
flood waters, because, surprising as it may seem to
one who has not tested the matter, floods do not
occur until after all surfaces, open fields and forests
alike, have become saturated, and then the run-off of
the two surfaces is equal.</p>

CLIMATES FOR HEALTH AND PLEASURE</h2>

<p class="p1b negin2">ONE’S LIFE WOULD BE PROLONGED IF, LIKE THE BIRDS,
ONE COULD MIGRATE ANNUALLY WITH THE TEMPERATURE—CHRISTMAS
IN MANY CLIMES—THE
HOTTEST AND COLDEST PLACES IN THE WORLD</p>


<p>From what has gone before it is apparent that
the regions of the earth where man is at his best
estate, so far as climate can determine his environment,
may be broadly defined in this country as
southern New England, southern and central New
York, the Middle Atlantic States, the Ohio Valley,
the southern Lake Region and westward to the middle
of Kansas and Nebraska; in Europe it includes the
British Isles, France, Switzerland, extreme northern
Italy, Austria, Germany, Belgium, Holland, and
the extreme southern parts of Norway and Sweden.
But in none of these regions is the climate equally
good during all seasons. In fact there are two short
seasons in each year when it is debilitating.</p>

<p>The great majority of the people, like galley<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_246"></a>[246]</span>
slaves chained to their oars, must remain in the
same place throughout the year, others may have a
vacation of several weeks, and still others are free
to change their location as often as fancy calls them.
The latter might well learn from the birds, and by
migrating with the temperature, going far north
in summer and far south in winter, maintain themselves
throughout the entire year in the most perfect
atmospheric conditions for health, happiness,
and long life. Many a man of fifty, having accumulated
enough to modestly supply his wants,
could add ten to thirty years to his life, or might
even double the period of his existence, by ceasing
to strive after riches, and by giving himself up to a
healthful movement about this beautiful world. His
principal companions should be good books,—the
study of which will enlarge his mental horizon and
increase his capacity to see, comprehend, and enjoy,
and fit him to speak, act, and think in ways that will
inure to the public good. If he has not had the
benefits of a college education, now is the golden
opportunity to read, and have pleasure in the reading,
popular books on Geology, Botany, Biology, Astronomy,
and Physics, and to become familiar with
the history of his own country and of the world.
It need not be a period of idleness but one of beautiful<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_247"></a>[247]</span>
growth and of appreciation of the wonders of
creation. And thus will his spirit be lifted up and
fitted for a higher realm of existence in the world to
come.</p>

<p>To those who must remain at home during heat
spells, the advice is given to close not only the
shutters but the windows on the east side of the
house during the forenoon and do the same on the
west side in the afternoon. The best night’s sleep
will be gained in a room facing north on any floor
that is not next the roof; this room will be cooler if
it is protected by another room on its east and one
on its west side.</p>

<p><b>Long Life in the Open Air and the Sunshine.</b> It
is difficult to decide which most conduces to health
and longevity: cheerfulness of mind and kindness of
thought, or life in the open air and in the blessed
sunshine. If one can enjoy both of these beneficent
conditions they should live as long as they
desire to remain on earth. <em>Most people live as long
as they deserve to live.</em> It has facetiously been said
that old age is a bad habit. The writer is disposed
to agree with the humorist. Certain it is that few
persons who believe in the limitation of life to three
score and ten ever live beyond that period, while
one should be possessed of a sound body and a superior<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_248"></a>[248]</span>
mind at that age, with just anticipations of a
third of a century of usefulness and happiness yet
to come. As a man thinketh, so is he. We are
just beginning to comprehend something of the
wonderful power with which the Creator has invested
us in the development and the care of our
bodies. Anger, hatred, malice, jealousy, selfishness,
fear, and worry create poisons that <em>may</em> bring on
disease and death, but they <em>certainly</em> create a morbidity
in the body that shortens life.</p>

<p>Sunshine destroys molds, bacteria, and other
enemies of the human race that lurk in the darkness.
It strikes dead the tubercle bacillus, which is such
a scourge to mankind. Its remedial power comes
largely from invisible light—the ultra-violet and the
supra-red rays. You are blind to these rays but
your skin and blood are not; they need the sunshine
to give them vitality—not quack medicines or
medical tonics for which, through the venal partnership
of the Press, millions of the afflicted are induced
not only to part with the money so much needed by
their families and themselves, but to aggravate
their sufferings. The sunshine of a high region is
beneficial to those ill with coughs, colds, bronchitis,
tuberculosis, anæmia, or other wasting diseases,
because the upper altitudes are rich in many rays<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_249"></a>[249]</span>
that are beneficial, some of which are absorbed by
the higher air and do not penetrate to the earth, or
only reach the earth in minute quantities. There
on the mountain the sun’s rays are unpolluted by the
dust and the bacteria of lower levels and the cities.
But one does not need extreme altitudes. Two to
three thousand feet may be sufficient.</p>

<p><b>Mountain and Sea Air and the Injury from Over-bathing.</b>
The seashore is properly a great national
playground during the heat of summer. Evaporated
spray leaves a trace of salt in the air which, with
the salt of the ocean, seems to be beneficial to many.
Likewise there is no condition of life that is not benefited
by the pure air of the wooded mountains.
Those of moderate vigor may build up and maintain
high vitality by continuous bathing in the cool,
pure waters of mountain lakes and streams, but to
many daily swimming in either fresh or salt water,
except that it be for a mere dip and right out again,
that is so cold as to be painful to the delicate sensations
of the skin, is extremely debilitating to all
bodily functions. Be moderate.</p>

<p><b>How to Find the Climate You Seek.</b> At sea level
in the tropics heat and moisture combine to produce
great physical discomfort. But even under the
equator it is possible to escape the tropical heat of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_250"></a>[250]</span>
low levels by ascending four to six thousand feet,
as can be done in some places in Porto Rico and
Cuba. Most of the capitals of South American
countries are located at altitudes of five to ten thousand
feet; and Brazil is planning to abandon her
capital at sea level and move the administrative
machinery of government from the splendid city of
Rio de Janeiro to a mountain location in the interior.</p>

<p>Any region of the Alleghany system of mountains
above a thousand feet elevation possesses climatic
conditions of therapeutic value. Illustration of this
fact is seen in the success of the noted sanitaria in
the Adirondacks, and in the mountain regions of
North Carolina and Virginia, and in the northern
part of New England. These sections are especially
frequented by persons suffering from pulmonary
diseases, or from nervous exhaustion, many of whom
find not only relief but cure. Cool and healthful
conditions of temperature may be found during the
summer along the ridges and on the peaks of the
entire mountain system that extends from North
Carolina northward through Virginia, Pennsylvania,
New York, and New England. The advice of one’s
physician should be sought, if one is ailing, before
determining between the seashore and the mountains,
but in general those suffering from diseases of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_251"></a>[251]</span>
respiratory organs are better located in the high
levels, remote from the humid air of the ocean.</p>

<p>In winter Bermuda, Florida, Porto Rico, Cuba,
the southern part of the Gulf States, much of Southern
California, and Hawaii have balmy climates
that permit of outdoor life without temperatures
too high to be comfortable. Hawaii and Bermuda
have mild climates not only during winter but
throughout the entire year. The Riviera on the
Gulf of Genoa and the beautiful Lake region of
Italy enjoy the balmy air of the Mediterranean and
are protected from the cold winter winds by the
Alps.</p>

<p>From October to May that portion of the Rocky
Mountain plateau that includes Arizona, New
Mexico, and the northern interior of Old Mexico
has one of the finest climates in the world for those
afflicted with pulmonary diseases, as the sunshine
is abundant and the day and night temperatures
such as to permit an almost continuous out-of-doors
existence. But the heat and the extreme dryness
of the air in June, July, August, and the first
half of September is irritating to the nerves and
debilitating in general. Fortunately, when the conditions
are not favorable in the extreme southwest
part of the country, they are at their best in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_252"></a>[252]</span>
mountains of the Middle Atlantic States and New
England, which offer to the pleasure or the health
seeker a cool, pure air unsurpassed by any other
region of the earth.</p>

<p>For an all-the-year climate for the health seeker,
it only can be said that the ideal conditions do not
continue at any place throughout the entire year.
Possibly it is well that it is so, as a change may be
beneficial for no reason except that it is a change.
There is one great caution ever to be borne in mind,
and that is that the health seeker must not continue
or repeat the same unhygienic life in his new
climate that brought on the disease in the old.</p>

<p><b>Climate of Cuba.</b> The climate of one tropical
country may differ materially from that of another
in the same latitude as a result of difference in
altitude, proximity to large bodies of water, and
position with respect to the prevailing winds. Cuba
being in the region of the northeast trade winds,
more rain falls on the north side of its mountains than
on the south side. The temperature of the southeast
coast is higher than it is on the northern and
western coasts, and the range of temperature everywhere
between night and day is small, rarely ten
degrees and usually much less. It therefore has a
warm, humid, and monotonous climate, except in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_253"></a>[253]</span>
the high levels of its mountains. The winter tourist
will find the conditions of the greater part of the
island somewhat similar to those in the region of
Miami, Florida, but warmer. Havana is not so hot as
Santiago. The highest temperature ever recorded at
Havana is 101° and the lowest 50°. A fairly pleasant
temperature always can be found within a short ride
to the mountains. As in most tropical countries,
Cuba has a dry and a wet season. The rainy season
is May to October. In the early part of September,
1900, over thirty-six inches of rain fell within thirty-six
hours at Santiago. As a rule the precipitation is
in the shape of heavy showers, the clouds clearing
as soon as the rain ceases; the showers usually
occur in the afternoon. Cuba, in common with
all the islands of the West Indies, occasionally is
visited by destructive hurricanes; these storms
mainly are confined to the period August to October.
Frequent terrific thunderstorms occur in summer.</p>

<p><b>Climate of Porto Rico.</b> Its mountainous character
gives it a marked diversity of climate, torrential
rains falling on the windward side of its mountains,
while the leeward sides are comparatively dry. The
highest temperature in San Juan since 1876 is 101°
and the lowest 57°. In this city a cool breeze, known
as the “briza”, adds to the comfort of the late<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_254"></a>[254]</span>
afternoon and evening. The wet season begins a
month earlier than in Cuba and lasts a month
longer. San Juan is probably the most healthful
city in the West Indies, but those reared in northern
climates invariably suffer from its enervating
influence after several years of continuous residence.
Water is abundant, there being some seventy rivers
and over a thousand small streams. The mountains
are clothed in vegetation to their tops, and
frost of a killing nature is practically unknown in the
island.</p>

<p><b>Climate of the Hawaiian Islands.</b> Much has
been written about the charm of the Hawaiian
Islands, their mountains, volcanoes, tropical verdure,
and delightful climate. It is indeed a garden spot,
and its soil and climate make it so. Nowhere in
the islands does the temperature reach 90° at any
time of the year, while at Honolulu, the largest city
and the capital, a temperature lower than 60° is
rarely experienced. Of course, as one ascends the
high mountains for which the group is noted, much
lower temperatures are encountered, while snow is
not infrequent near the tops. July and August
are the warmest months and January the coldest.
The climate is soothing and dreamy and doubtless
would prolong the life of many who are aged and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_255"></a>[255]</span>
slowly passing to their end, and that of others of
low vitality but no organic disease. Most of the
rain falls November to May, but some falls in every
month of the year. At Honolulu the amount is
about that which falls in Wisconsin, but at a station
in the Kohala Mountains one hundred and fifty-four
inches have been measured as the rainfall for seven
months, and forty-two inches for one month, the
latter being a larger amount than the annual rainfall
for the State of Iowa.</p>

<p><b>Climate of the Philippines.</b> The highest temperature
so far recorded at Manila is 100° and the lowest
60°. It is therefore warmer than either Havana
or Porto Rico. The hottest months are April,
May, and June, but the cool months are but a trifle
cooler than the warm months, the annual range of
temperature being but three degrees. The humidity
is high at all seasons, and therefore the heat is oppressive
and debilitating. The greater part of the
rainfall of Manila is from June to October. Some
relief may be gained from the low-level heat by retreat
to the mountains of some of the islands. It
will require several generations before the white
man can become acclimated to this region. The
islands lie between latitude 6° and 18° North. White
children born of American parents and raised<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_256"></a>[256]</span>
there never will have the energy or ambition of
their progenitors. If it were not for the invigorating
air of the mountain resort at Baquio,
many American officials could not continue a residence
in the Philippines.</p>

<p><b>Climate of Bermuda in Comparison with the
Popular Winter Resorts of Florida and California.</b>
It is a mistake to represent the climate of Bermuda
as one of balmy sunshine during winter
months. It has some glorious days, but a large proportion
are cloudy, rainy, cool, and windy, and too
cold for comfortable or healthful bathing from the
middle of December to the first of May. And yet,
its climate is healthful as a whole for nine months of
the year and more stimulating than is that of
Florida in winter. If one wishes sunshine and sea
bathing in midwinter, it is better to go to Palm
Beach, St. Petersburg, or Miami, Florida; but if one
desires to have a moderately cool climate with a
temperature of but little variation between midday
and midnight, and occasionally a day with sufficient
warmth and sunshine to justify a dip in the
ocean or in the many land-locked bays with which
the islands abound, one well may come to Bermuda.
Such winter clothing as one naturally would wear in
Philadelphia or Washington is what one will need in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_257"></a>[257]</span>
order to be comfortable. Bermuda is no place for
Palm Beach suits, outing shirts, and Panama hats
in winter. Many tourists are mislead by the advertisements
of steamship lines and bring clothing
which is suitable only for early fall and late
spring.</p>

<p>From the first of November to the middle of May
the author occupied a room on the ground floor,
facing the waters of Hamilton Harbor, and only
fifty feet from the shore line. Here the diurnal
range of temperature is much less than at Prospect
Hill, where the Government’s observations are made.
From the middle of December to the middle of March,
a thermometer in this room sluggishly ranged from
60° at night to 64° during the day, and days when the
wind was high and rain falling—as occurs about
one third of the time in winter—the thermometer
would not vary a degree from 60° during the entire
twenty-four hours. During April the range each
day was from 68° at night to 70° at midday, and
during November and May from 70° to 76°.</p>

<p>The selection of the best winter climate for health
and for pleasure is so important that comparative
data are here given of the most popular places that
are easy of access to the people of the United States.</p>

<p>Bermuda has a wind velocity much greater than<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_258"></a>[258]</span>
that of any of the resorts named in the tables, and
its relative humidity is about that of Florida.</p>

<p>The charm of Bermuda is that the flowers bloom,
vegetables grow, and the trees remain green the year
round. Even though frequent short showers may
fall each twenty-four hours more than half of the
days during winter, the soil is so porous that there
is little or no mud, and life is largely one of the open
air, with a winter temperature that conduces to activity;
in fact, the temperature is such that one
requires heavy clothing all the time if one is to sit
inactive in the open. There is neither frost, fog, nor
malaria, nor snakes.</p>

<p>Bermuda lies 666 miles south of New York City
and about 700 miles due east from Charleston, S. C.,
and 293 miles from the southern edge of the Gulf
Stream, which, if the truth must be told, exercises
no such influence on the climate of Bermuda as
highly colored advertising circulars would have one
believe. It is the great ocean, upon whose surface
the islands make the most infinitesimal dot, that controls
the climate of the Bermudas. The Gulf Stream,
wonderful phenomenon that it is, is a sort of bug-a-boo
to some who never have intelligently studied
ocean meteorology. Travelers tell of the superheated
atmosphere they encountered on crossing the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_259"></a>[259]</span>
Stream, and educators who should know better
teach that the entire climate of Europe is markedly
influenced by it. The fact is that there is no distortion
whatever of the isothermal lines as they
enter and leave the Gulf stream in any region north
of Bermuda. (See <a href="#i_ch14">Chart 14</a>.) The climate of Bermuda
and of Europe is controlled largely by the
great Atlantic Ocean, not by this small river of warm
water, which broadens out and loses its identity
long before the coast of Europe is reached, and whose
influence is soon dissipated in the vast expanse of
ocean air. The ocean has a great circulating system,
northward on the western and southward on its eastern
side. This circulation pushes the isothermal lines
northward on one side and southward on the other.</p>

<p>The islands of Bermuda rise some 15,000 feet from
the floor of the ocean, and project above the water
to heights varying from 50 to 260 feet above sea
level. Like jewels nestling upon the bosom of a
sub-tropical ocean these islands, from one half to
three miles wide, are strung along so close that one
almost can hop over from one to the other. They
lie in the form of a fish-hook; from the hole where
the line of the fisherman would be tied to the point
of the hook is about twenty-six miles. The topography
is irregular and picturesque. On land there<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_260"></a>[260]</span>
are caves and grottoes and subterranean lakes. January
to May rose borders are abloom. In April the
oleander is showing pink and crimson along every
roadside, and the hedges hold these beautiful flowers
for months; at Easter time lilies carpet the ground
and perfume the air. Here morning glories have
many forms and colors, which, with pendent bells,
climb wide-spreading cedar trees, and wild passion
flowers cover rocky cliffs.</p>

<p>The sea is so transparent that many feet below
the surface the eye may follow the movements of
marine life housed about by coral formations of
strange devices. The colors of the sea are as changeable
as the opal. Over shallow bottoms the colors
are delicate shades of light green, over the shoals
brownish hues, and beyond the dangerous reefs, which
have sent many a sailor to his long home, and behind
which numerous pirates of old have taken refuge, the
waters vary from the light blue of the sapphire to deep
green. The prismatic colors are forever laughing
and dancing to the eye of the beholder. The shadow
of a cloud, a ripple of the surface, a different angle to
the fall of sunshine as the day advances, deepen or
brighten the tints through a wide range of color.</p>

<p>Through the glass bottom of a boat one may look
into the gardens. Rising from the bottom and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_261"></a>[261]</span>
waving gracefully with the movements of the waters,
like tree ferns moved by gentle zephyrs, are purple
sea fans and tall black rods. Beautifully colored
fishes dart about, or lazily bask in the sun that illumines
their coral grottoes; weeds of many colors;
green and scarlet sponges; vegetable growths delicate
in formation and brilliant anemones cling to ledges
of rock that here and there are tinted with pink.</p>

<p>Rival champions of the east and the west coasts
of Florida may fortify themselves by a study of the
tables. It may be noted that Miami and Tampa
have the same midday temperature, but that Tampa
has a greater range, the night temperature on the
average falling five degrees lower than Miami; also
that Tampa, which can be taken as typical of St.
Petersburg, has but twenty-one rainy days on an
average from December to March inclusive, while
Miami has thirty-four. Bermuda has sixty-five
days with rain during the period, with much wind.
From these data one may select the climate that
best suits him and he may know that the data are
accurate and put forth by some one not interested
in advancing the interest of one place over another.
No country in the world has more delightful and
healthful climates for winter and for summer than
can be found in the wide domain of the United States.</p>

<p class="p2">The Scientific American thus speaks of the uses of
climatic data:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“What are climatic statistics good for? To this
query one is tempted to retort: What are they <em>not</em>
good for? Let us set down a few typical cases in
which such data are desired.</p>

<p>“A merchant plans to undertake the sale of rubber
coats in foreign markets. Hence he wishes to
know all about the distribution of rainfall, both
geographically and as to season. Which are the
rainy regions of the globe? When do the heaviest
occur in each of these regions? Where do the prevailing
temperatures indicate the need of heavy
coats, and where light?</p>

<p>“An invalid contemplates visiting a certain health
resort. What mean temperatures occur there at
the season of the proposed visit? What ranges of
temperature between day and night? How much
does the temperature vary from day to day? How
much sunshine may be expected? Is the atmosphere
moist or dry? What of the winds? Such
are some of the questions he is likely to ask.</p>

<p>“A horticulturist proposes to introduce a foreign
plant in this country. Where will he find the most
favorable climate for it? In order to settle this
question he first tries to secure certain information
about the climate of the plant’s original habitat—the
march of temperature through the season of
growth, average dates of first and last frost, normal
fluctuations of rainfall, humidity, sunshine, etc.
If the desired information is obtained, the next<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_266"></a>[266]</span>
step is to ascertain where (if anywhere) similar
climatic conditions prevail in the United States,
and this is generally an easy task.</p>

<p>“An engineer is planning a sewer system. He
needs data of excessive rainfall for the locality under
consideration, so that he may estimate the maximum
amount of storm-water the sewers will ever
need to dispose of in a given time. Their capacity
should not exceed this amount beyond a reasonable
margin of safety: otherwise cost of construction
would be unnecessarily great.</p>

<p>“This list of examples might be extended almost
indefinitely. It will suffice, however, to show how
wide a range of climatic information is required to
meet all possible demands. The different branches
of industry are concerned with different sets of climatic
data. One set helps determine the best location
for a railroad: another the kind of goods
that will be shipped over it and the way in which
they will need to be packed and cared for during
shipment. The climatic conditions that must be
considered in planning a military campaign are
quite unlike those that engage the attention of a
hydrological engineer in laying out a system of irrigation.
Climatic statistics of interest to aviators
are not identical with those that bear upon the problems
of ecology or forestry or sanitation. In short,
climate means different things to different people.”</p>
</div>

<p><b>Christmas in Many Climes.</b> A general idea of
the diversification of climate may be gathered from
a description of the weather of some particular day<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_267"></a>[267]</span>
of the year as it exists in many different parts of the
world. One is too prone to assume that the weather
one has on a given day prevails everywhere. For
the moment one does not consider the effect of distance
from the equator, proximity to large bodies of
water, and elevation above sea level and above the
surrounding region. When a holiday or any day of
special interest occurs, while the weather cannot
make the occasion a success, it can quite effectively
destroy all pleasure in the event. When we approach
the day of all days in the year when two
fifths of the people of the world celebrate the natal
day of Christ, interest in the weather increases.
The little ones of our clime pray that a mantle of
snow may cover the ground, so that dear old Santa
Claus may come with his reindeer and sleigh. The
boys and girls long for the snow-covered hillsides
and the glassy ponds; and even our good old grandmother
smiles in anticipation of such a Christmas
Day as gladdened her heart when she was a wee tot.</p>

<p>It may be interesting to know under what kind
of skies the people of other lands celebrate this international
holiday. In the Northern Hemisphere
places near the same latitude may have weather conditions
greatly at variance the one from the other,
because of conditions previously explained. It is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_268"></a>[268]</span>
our winter now; not because the sun is farthest
from us, for in five days the earth will reach the time
of perihelion in its course around the sun, and be
nearer to the central luminary than at any other time
of the year, but because the inclination of the earth’s
axis causes us to receive the rays of the sun at a lower
angle than during any other season and its intensity
is reduced. The conditions are reversed to the
people of the Southern Hemisphere; they now
receive the most direct rays of the sun and have
their summer, which is intensified by the nearness of
the earth to the sun.</p>

<p>The event that gave origin to our Christmas holiday
occurred nearly two thousand years ago in
Bethlehem of Judea; and it may be a new idea to
us to try to think of the weather that prevailed at
that time and the character of the Christmas Day
that land may have this year. We know that it
was not cold and cloudy on that eventful night so
long ago, for the shepherds were feeding their flocks
upon the hillsides and the Wise Men of the East
beheld a star and followed it. The star shone
brightly from the time they left Herod until they
reached the place where the Infant lay. We may
therefore judge that this part of their journey was
made under a clear sky and that the same conditions<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_269"></a>[269]</span>
prevailed at Bethlehem. Weather observations
made at Jerusalem, a few miles from Bethlehem,
during modern times, show that during December
there are less than fourteen cloudy days on the
average. The prevailing winds are from the Mediterranean
Sea, only thirty miles to the west of
Bethlehem, and therefore rarely does the temperature
exceed 65° during the day or fall to freezing
at night. While there is evidence that the climate
is drier now throughout all of the Holy Land than
at the birth of Christ, it is highly probable that
when He was born the stars were shining brightly
and the hills were green and beautiful and the
weather smiling its benediction upon the Son of
God.</p>

<p>We now will glance at the weather that experience
teaches us will probably prevail in some of the principal
cities of the world on Christmas Day, and
thus have impressed upon us the fact that on any
day of the year humanity lives under widely differing
weather conditions throughout the world.</p>

<p>In our own country we know that Maine is the
home of ice, snow, and chilling blasts, while in
California and Florida orange blossoms perfume the
temperate air.</p>

<p>In London Christmas is not always bright and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_270"></a>[270]</span>
comfortable, for on the average twenty-one days in
December are cloudy and the temperature ranges
from a few degrees below freezing at night to about
50° during the day.</p>

<p>In Paris the weather is about the same as in
London. It has the same percentage of cloudiness,
and its daily range of temperature is from 32° to 45°,
slightly colder than London. The influence of
wind direction and the relation of water and land
areas to the location of a city are well exemplified
in the fact that Paris, farther south than London,
has a lower winter temperature. In the United
States the coldest winter winds are from the
northwest and they also would be so in Western
Europe were it not for the fact that they draw
from the ocean, whose waters are much warmer
in winter than the interior of the continent of Europe.
The northeast winds are therefore the coldest that
come to Paris and London. In the first case they
draw from the cold interior, and in the second case
the air in passing to London from the northeast
must pass over the North Sea and the extreme
temperature of the cold land is somewhat modified
by even this comparatively small body of water
with the result that the average daily maximum
temperature of London for December is five degrees<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_271"></a>[271]</span>
warmer than its neighbor some two hundred miles
farther south.</p>

<p>Berlin and Vienna have the same degree of cloudiness,
but there the similarity ceases. Berlin, only
about one hundred miles from the Baltic Sea on the
northeast and about double this distance from the
North Sea on the northwest has an average range
of but eight degrees between day and night temperatures,
while Vienna, deep-set in the interior of a
great continent, has a daily range of thirty-seven
degrees, the average temperature swinging from
13° to 50° each day during December.</p>

<p>Constantinople was named after the Roman
Emperor who made it his capital and who first protected
the early Christians from persecution, then
became converted and, in the manner of his time,
forced others to accept the doctrine at the point of
the sword. Here Christianity was first recognized
and adopted as a State religion, but since the middle
of the fifteenth century Constantinople has been
the home of the Sultan of Turkey and the principal
city of those who worship Muhammid as the prophet
of God instead of Christ. This ancient city, so
interwoven in the history of Christianity, has a
delightful climate at Christmas time, the daily
range being from between a little above freezing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_272"></a>[272]</span>
and 65° or 70°, with clouds obscuring the sky about
one half the time.</p>

<p>Historical Rome has about as many clear days as
cloudy ones and the days are pleasant and the nights
simply cool.</p>

<p>At Cairo, in the land where Joseph was sold into
bondage and where Pharaoh raised him to the
highest position in the land next to his own, no more
delightful place can the traveler find at Christmas
time. Only one day in three is cloudy and the
gentle winds are warm and balmy, with a daily
range in temperature of 12°.</p>

<p>In Calcutta there is a great amount of sunshine,
only one day in five being cloudy, with an average
daily minimum temperature of 58° and a maximum
of 80°.</p>

<p>Bombay is also sunshiny at this time of the year
and excessively hot, with a range each day from 66°
to 88°. Here, as at Calcutta, Brahmanism and
Buddhism rule instead of Christianity.</p>

<p>China, that enormous empire that believes in the
ethical philosophy of Confucius, whose inhabitants
have lived for four thousand years with less strife
and bloodshed than any other nation, has as great
a variety of climate during December in the widely
separated parts of its broad domain as has the United<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_273"></a>[273]</span>
States. On any day of the Christmas month some
parts of this country are bound in icy chains, while
other parts are sweltering in a torrid temperature.</p>

<p>That wonderful Island—Japan—whose people
have made such amazing strides in catching up with
the most advanced civilization of the Occident, and
who never have accepted Christianity, has a most
delightful climate during winter, with a large amount
of sunshine and moderate temperatures.</p>

<p>The vast Christian nation so long ruled by the
Tzar, and now in such deplorable chaos, has a varied
climate during December. From temperate conditions
in the southern portion of its European
possessions it gradually grows colder as one goes
northward until a region of great severity is reached.
At Petrograd the average night temperature is 6°
below zero. At Moscow it is colder, the average
of its minimum temperature being 11° below. Two
thirds of the time it is cloudy at these two cities.</p>

<p>Verkhoyansk, in the central portion of Siberia, is
nearly the coldest place in the world where observations
are regularly taken. There Christmas Day may
be ushered in with a temperature as low as 75° below
zero. For days at a time this extreme cold remains,
the warmest part of the day varying but little from
the coldest.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_274"></a>[274]</span></p>

<p>In many of the cities of the Southern Hemisphere
Christmas Day is likely to be such as will cause the
sojourner to long for some cooler region. There
it is midsummer, the grass is green and the fruit is
on the tree. We of the North could hardly realize
that it is December. In the pampas of the Argentine
Republic everything is parched. The white
stucco walls and the red tile roofs in the cities reflect
the intense rays of the sun into the shimmering air.
In Rio de Janeiro the days are almost unbearable, the
daily temperature rising to 100° and over at midday
and seldom falling to 60° at night. Bear in mind
that the greater part of the area of South America
lies between the equator and 30° south latitude.
But wherever in these South American cities one
can escape to an elevation of several thousand feet
a pleasant temperature may be found.</p>

<p>At Santiago, Chili, it is more comfortable than in
Brazil, for the nights are cool, even though the day
temperatures rival those of the Argentine Republic.
But here the cool mountain tops are almost hanging
over the coast cities.</p>

<p>At Cape Town, in the extreme south part of Africa,
two days out of three are clear and the daily range
of temperature is from 48° to 83°, making fairly
pleasant conditions during the Christmas holidays.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_275"></a>[275]</span></p>

<p>At Melbourne, Australia, one half of the days are
cloudy, and the temperature is moderate, having a
range from 54° to 75°.</p>

<p>Thus we see that the climatological features of
the world, not only on Christmas but on any other
day of the year, are as varied as the hopes and
wishes of man, and whatever his desires or physical
necessities may be, a climate may be found under
the influence of which he may find pleasure and
gain health.</p>

<p><b>The Hottest and the Coldest Places in the World.</b>
It is an innate characteristic of the human race to be
interested in the abnormal, whether it be in the
achievements of men or in the extremes of natural
phenomena. This is especially true with regard to
the weather. During periods of extremes of heat
or cold the natural inquiry is as to whether there
ever has been a period of equal or greater severity.
Although suffering intensely there always is a desire
to “beat the record.” It therefore may be of
interest briefly to refer to the hottest and the coldest
places in the world.</p>

<p><b>North America.</b> One of the most torrid places in
the United States is in that remarkable region known
as Death Valley. It is located in Southern California.
Its name is supposed to be derived from a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_276"></a>[276]</span>
melancholy tragedy that occurred in 1850, in which
every member of a party of emigrants perished in
Death Valley from thirst and exhaustion, leaving
the bones of themselves and their animals to whiten
in the sun. The valley is the bed of an ancient salt
sea which existed when the climate was much
wetter than now; its soil is largely composed of sand,
salt, and borax. The borax deposits are large; at
places they form crusts that support the weight of
travelers. The length of the valley is seventy-five
miles, but it is narrow at the bottom, in places
being no more than six miles. One of its remarkable
features is that its bottom, in many places, is three
hundred feet below the level of the sea, one hundred
miles to the west. It is fed by several small streams
and innumerable warm springs, the water from which
is entirely absorbed by the porous soil, although
water may be found by digging down a few feet.
The water is unfit for use. It is a desolate and
forbidden region, inhabited by gnats, toads, lizards,
and snakes. However, the employees of a company
engaged in the business of marketing borax spend
a portion of each year there.</p>

<p>In 1891 an observer of the U. S. Weather Bureau
remained in Death Valley from May to September,
during which time he made daily observations of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_277"></a>[277]</span>
the weather. His experience was a most trying
one, drawing heavily upon his physical and mental
stamina to complete the period of time that had been
set for him. For the entire time of one hundred
and fifty-four days less than one half an inch of
rain fell. There occurred several days in succession
with a temperature of 122°. However, this is not
the highest temperature ever recorded in the United
States. In July, 1887, at Mammoth Tank, in the
Colorado Desert, the temperature reached 128°
in the shade, and again, in 1884, 124° was reached
at the same place. On July 18, 1891, in Death
Valley, the maximum was 120° and the minimum
99°, making an average for all hours of 108.6°. The
extremely high temperatures reached in the Colorado
Desert, which embraces a portion of Southern California
and Arizona, do not vary greatly from those
of Death Valley; they are not exceeded anywhere in
Central or North America. Such degrees of heat,
if experienced for two or three weeks in the more
humid regions of the eastern half of the United
States, would nearly depopulate the region by the
havoc of death.</p>

<p>The lowest temperatures in the United States
occur in extreme northern portions of Minnesota,
North Dakota, and Montana, where temperatures<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_278"></a>[278]</span>
from 50° to 55° below zero have been recorded. It
is interesting to note that in this same region the
summer temperatures have risen to readings of from
105° to 108°. Of course this heat is quite different
in its effects upon life from the heat of the Gulf or
Atlantic coasts. One feels a marked difference between
the sun and the shade temperatures in these
semi-arid regions. Sunstroke is infrequent and death
seldom results from exposure, as it does in the East.</p>

<p>The region of severest cold in North America is
found about the Great Bear Lake in the British
Northwest Territory, where temperatures of 58°
below zero have been recorded.</p>

<p><b>South America.</b> The hottest portion of South
America is in the interior, with extensive systems
of mountain ranges along the coast preventing
the inward flow of the moist rain-bearing winds
from the ocean. In a stretch of country extending
from Uruguay northward into the interior of Brazil,
the average of the highest temperature of each
year for a period of several years is 104°, with individual
readings much higher. Except on the top
of the mountains, or well up their sides, no severely
cold weather occurs in South America, seven eighths
of its territory lying between the equator and latitude
30° south.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_279"></a>[279]</span></p>

<p><b>Africa.</b> In Africa is to be found the hottest
region of the world, the great Desert of Sahara,
upon whose sands beats down the fierce tropical
sun with merciless intensity. Here shade temperatures
of 130° are frequently experienced. Only
those bred to extreme tropical desert heat can long
live under such conditions. In a portion of the
desert lying between Egypt and the Red Sea the
temperature has been known not to fall below 113°
for a period of ten days, while on several nights the
lowest temperature reached was 118°, with a practically
calm air. Africa lies with about one half of its
immense area on each side of the equator, and the
greater part of its territory inside the Tropical Zone.
Except in a few isolated cases on high mountains,
temperatures as low as zero never are experienced.</p>

<p><b>Europe.</b> The warmest portion of Europe is in the
region round and about the Mediterranean Sea.
The coldest places in all Europe are in the western
part of Russia and in the northern part of the Scandinavian
Peninsula. Here the average of the coldest
days of winter is 50° below zero.</p>

<p><b>Asia.</b> It is difficult to determine in what part of
Asia the highest temperature occurs, as data from
many parts are meager. It is known however that
extremely hot weather prevails in India and Arabia.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_280"></a>[280]</span>
Siberia, however, experiences the coldest weather
to be found anywhere in the world. At Werchojansk,
in that country, a temperature of 90.4° below
zero was observed in January, 1884, while the
average temperature for the whole month was
69.4° below zero.</p>

<p>The coldest weather of the world is not found
at the North or the South Pole, as many suppose,
but rather at the center of vast continents, far from
the modifying influence of oceans.</p>

<p><b>Australia.</b> In extreme heat the interior of Australia
is fairly comparable with northern Africa,
Persia, Afghanistan, and northern India, where
every year maximum temperatures of 115° occur,
and where, at times, an extreme heat of 120° or
125° is experienced in the shade.</p>

<p>We now know that the forceful, dominating
peoples come out of the regions where the heat is
not so great as to debilitate, nor the cold so fierce
as to deaden the mental and the physical faculties;
but rather from the region of the thoroughfare
of the great circum-polar storm tracks, where there
are frequent changes of weather from sunshine to
clouds, and where there is a fairly wide difference
in temperature between night and day and between
winter and summer. For the best coördination<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_281"></a>[281]</span>
of the mental and the physical faculties, so as to
produce the most efficient composite of man, the
temperature should range between 45° and 50° at
night and between 65° and 70° during the day, with
about sixty-five to seventy per cent. of relative humidity.
Some day we will artificially create the
exact conditions of temperature and moisture needed
for patients in hospitals and sanitaria. Science is
persistently seeking means to increase comfort and
prolong life.</p>

<h2 class="p2 nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XV">CHAPTER XV<br>
CONDENSATION</h2>

<p class="p1b pfs80">HOW HAZE, RAIN, SNOW, HAIL, FROST, CLOUD, AND FOG
ARE FORMED</p>


<p><b>Haze</b> is what might be called diluted cloud or fog;
it differs from them only in the degree of its density.
One may see several miles through a haze, because
the minute particles of spheres of water or ice are
far apart in comparison to what they are in fog or
cloud.</p>

<p><b>Raindrops</b> vary in size from O.03 to O.20 of an
inch in diameter. Each drop is composed of literally
millions of minute specks of water that have condensed
each about a minute mote of dust. These
motes are a million of times below anything that may
be seen with the most powerful microscope. Recall
what is said in <a href="#CHAPTER_IV">Chapter IV</a> about the size of the
molecules in water: if a raindrop were enlarged to
the size of the earth, the molecules of which it is
composed would be no larger than a baseball, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_283"></a>[283]</span>
the smallest of them no larger than tiny green peas.
Without free surfaces upon which condensation
may begin there can be no rainfall. Dust motes
furnish these surfaces; without them air may be
supersaturated without condensation occurring except
where it comes in contact with solid matter.
The little spherical masses of water join together so
as to form raindrops in some manner not well understood.
When enough of them coalesce so that the
weight of the drop is too heavy to be supported by the
motions of the air it falls to the ground, or is evaporated
by the warmer and drier lower air. Raindrops
form mainly in the stratum between one and
three miles above the earth. It is seldom that the
stratum of air next the earth is saturated, even
during rainfall. One might evaporate millions of
gallons of water and find no dust as a residue, or at
least nothing visible to the human eye, so infinitesimal
are the motes of condensation. As high as
thirty millions have been shown to exist in a single
cubic centimeter of air (<a href="#CHAPTER_IV">Chapter IV</a>), and a million
times that number could occupy such space
without being visible, and the dust mote is composed
of molecules, and the molecules of atoms. It is
impossible for the human mind to grasp the idea of
the degree of smallness to which the atom attains,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_284"></a>[284]</span>
and when one tries to conceive of the electrons from
which the atom is built up, he must try to think of
them not as objects but as the place or condition
where matter slowly fades away into nothing; as
the place possibly where matter is transmuted into
electrical energy and ceases to exist.</p>

<p>The raindrop cannot be formed at great altitudes
because the vaporous atmosphere is confined to
low levels by temperature. At 100°, which often
exists at the bottom of the atmosphere, air at saturation
contains 19.77 grains the cubic foot; at 80°,
10.93; at zero, .04; and at -40°, which always
may be found at about four and one half miles high,
air cannot contain in excess of .01 of a grain. Raindrops
are mainly caused by the cooling of air down
to its dew point.</p>

<p><b>Rain Water Is Not Pure.</b> Hailstones often incase
foreign matter that has been carried upward by violent
winds. Rain water is pure when it is condensed,
but it gathers other matter as it falls, such
as the pollen of plants, and the broken siliceous
shells of microscopic life carried by winds of the
tropics; it also washes ammonia from the air in
small quantities,—about thirty pounds per acre in
the eastern half of the United States each year. A
raindrop increases in velocity as it falls until the resistance<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_285"></a>[285]</span>
of the air becomes just equal to the weight
of the drop; after that it falls at a uniform rate.
It will surprise many to learn that if it were not
for the retardation effected by the resistance of the
air, a raindrop falling from only half a mile would
be as dangerous to life as a rifle bullet, for the speed
with which a projectile travels can be made sufficient
to compensate for its softness or yielding qualities.</p>

<p><b>How Much Water Is It Possible to Precipitate
from the Earth’s Atmosphere?</b> If the entire amount
of water vapor present in the atmosphere were
precipitated instantly it would furnish a rainfall
of only two inches for the whole surface of the
earth. A steady downpour for twenty-four hours
usually amounts to some two or three inches. Over
small areas and in exceptional cases as many feet
have been known to fall in that time, as fresh,
vapor-bearing winds steadily blew into a storm center,
rose, discharged their burdens as they cooled with
ascent, and then flowed away, again to be charged
with moisture when they came into contact with
wet surfaces. It is impossible to drown the entire
earth with rainfall, no matter how long continued.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp75" id="i_fig31" style="max-width: 50em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_p286a.jpg" alt="Nine different snowflakes">
  <figcaption class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 31.—Snow Crystals.</span></figcaption>
</figure>

<p><b>Snow.</b> Snow is water vapor condensed in the
congealed form, without passing through the liquid
state. When the minute pieces of ice of which the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_286"></a>[286]</span>
flake is composed are magnified several hundred
times they are found to be composed of the most
wonderfully beautiful figures. Thousands have been
photographed, but the versatility of nature is so
great that no two ever have been found that were
exactly alike. <a href="#i_fig31">Figure 31</a> gives some idea of their
infinite variety and perfect symmetry. They are
always governed by the number six. The most
common form at the beginning of winter is a six-rayed
star, each ray branching. As the winter
advances and the cold becomes more severe, the
flakes take a simpler form, finally becoming slender
six-sided prisms with sharp ends, under the influence
of severe cold waves. Great pain is inflicted on
the exposed parts of the body when these prisms
are encountered in a high wind.</p>

<p>When condensation takes place in a warm stratum
it will be in the form of minute massive spherical
particles or spherules. If these spherules are then
whirled aloft by ascending currents it is possible
for them to be cooled to far below the freezing
point without turning to ice; they will, however,
congeal instantly when they touch one another or
are jostled by touching any solid or liquid surface.
They may give a coating of ice to the limbs of trees
and the coating may increase until the limbs break,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_287"></a>[287]</span>
and the surface of the earth thus may be covered
with thin ice called <em>sleet</em>.</p>

<p><b>Hail.</b> There is a difference of opinion among
meteorologists as whether the thunderstorm whirls
about a vertical axis, like the tornado and the
hurricane, or whether it rotates about a horizontal
axis. One may well account for the formation of
the hailstone by assuming that its alternating layers
of snow and ice are caused by the horizontal roll
of a thunderstorm, the under part of which has a
temperature at or above freezing and the upper
half much below freezing. A raindrop is formed
in the lower part, frozen in its course through the
upper part, receives a fresh coating of water or snow
with each revolution and a freezing before its circuit
is completed. It thus gains in size until it becomes
too heavy to be sustained by the whirling storm-cloud,
when it falls to earth. Hail usually has the
size of small peas, but occasionally it falls in chunks
sufficiently large to kill cattle in the fields. On
August 15, 1883, a hailstone weighing eighty pounds
is said to have fallen in Kansas.</p>

<p><b>Frost.</b> Frost is composed of beautiful crystallizations,
similar to snow. <a href="#CHAPTER_VII">Chapter VII</a> describes
the process of formation in detail.</p>

<p><b>Cloud.</b> Cloud is formed by the cooling by expansion<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_288"></a>[288]</span>
as currents of air are carried aloft. Clouds
are composed of minute watery droplets or of ice
spiculæ, depending on their temperature, and
the latter largely is determined by elevation. A
cloud differs from mist or rain in the size and number
of its particles, and from fog in its position and
the method of its formation. There are three
fundamental formations, the cirrus, cumulus, and
stratus. The others are combinations of these.
The cirrus are thin, high, veil-like clouds, always
composed of ice spiculæ; the cumulus look like
great banks of snow with bulging, oval tops in which
thunder heads may form; the stratus spread out
like a great blanket. The cirrus usually fly at the
top of the storm stratum, some five to seven miles
high; the other clouds at some lower level. When
rain is falling from a cloud, it is called nimbus.</p>

<p><b>Fog Is Cloud at a Low Level.</b> It is formed by
warm water vapor rising from lakes or rivers into
the cool night air at the bottom of valleys, or by the
cold waters of oceans being forced up over a bar,
where the coldness that they impart to the adjacent
air condenses some of its vapor.</p>

<p><b>Artificial Rain Making.</b> Many swindlers have
preyed upon the credulity of the public by claiming
to have a process for the making of rain, and in some<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_289"></a>[289]</span>
cases large sums of money have been paid by commercial
or other associations to these charlatans.
In 1892 the United States Congress appropriated
$20,000 for the testing of the theory that rain
could be created by the setting off of large quantities
of explosives. The experiment was unsuccessful,
as the scientists of the Government insisted
it would be. The Greeks had a popular belief that
when a host of their soldiers went out to meet an
army of Persians the vapor rising from the hot
breath, blood, and sweat of the struggling mass was
later condensed into rain by the concussion of the
battle clubs and the hoarse cries of the victors,
and many of the veterans of our Civil War were
firm in the opinion that their great battles were
followed by rains that were the result of the cannonading.
Both the Greeks and our American
soldiers were mistaken. Rain often has fallen at the
close of great battles, not because of the concussion
of the conflict, but because rain falls on an average of
one day in three in the regions where most of the great
battles have been fought, and the movement of armies
began on the fair days when travel was good. If it
were the custom to begin battles on rainy days
we would have the contrary and equally erroneous
theory that concussion clears the atmosphere.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_290"></a>[290]</span></p>

<p><b>Prevention of Hail by the Firing of Guns.</b> Even
a Papal decree was not entirely effective in preventing
the people in southern Europe from ringing
the church bells to prevent the formation of hail
when a storm threatened, and within the past
quarter-century large grants of public money were
foolishly wasted in the firing by the vineyardists
of France and other parts of Europe of a gun specially
designed to destroy hail clouds. These guns
sent harmless smoke rings a few feet aloft. The
writer felt constrained to employ the extensive
machinery of the Weather Bureau to counteract
the effect of glowing accounts of the success of these
guns that were sent to this country by some of the
ignorant persons employed by this Government
to represent us as consuls abroad. Even though
the hail-destroying guns occasionally were choked
with hail it was difficult for scientists to prevail
upon the public to stop their foolish and wasteful
practice.</p>

DEVELOPMENT OF THE AMERICAN WEATHER SERVICE</h2>

<p class="p1b pfs80">THE LARGEST AND THE MOST EFFECTIVE METEOROLOGICAL
BUREAU IN THE WORLD</p>


<p>Even to those who are familiar with the application
of meteorological science to the making of
weather forecasts, and with the material benefits
accruing to the commerce and industry of the
United States from timely warnings of marine storms,
frosts, and cold waves, it will be interesting to note
that at the time of the founding of the first of the
thirteen original Colonies, at Jamestown, Virginia,
in 1607, practically nothing was known of the
properties of the air or of methods for measuring
its forces. To-day electrically recording automatic
meteorological instruments measure and transcribe
for each moment of time at two hundred stations
in the United States, the temperature, the air pressure,
the velocity of the wind, the direction of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_292"></a>[292]</span>
wind, the beginning and ending of rainfall, with
the amount of precipitation; and the presence of
sunshine or cloud; and three thousand voluntary
observers each day record the temperature and
the rainfall.</p>

<p>That we live in an age of great intellectual acumen,
and that he is indeed a wise prophet who can even
dimly outline the possibilities of the next century,
is fitly shown by the development of meteorological
science during the recollection of the present
generation; although one must admit that in the
making of weather forecasts, valuable as they are,
we have not advanced beyond the partly empirical
stage. It is, therefore, improbable that in the
making of these forecasts we shall ever attain the
accuracy acquired by theoretical astronomy in
predicting the date of an eclipse or the culmination
of any celestial event.</p>

<p>It was not until 1644, twenty-four years after the
landing of the Pilgrims at Plymouth Rock, that
Torricelli discovered the principle of the barometer
and rendered it possible to measure the weight
of the superincumbent air at any spot where the
wonderful yet simple little instrument might be
placed. Torricelli’s great teacher—Galileo—died
without knowing why nature, under certain conditions,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_293"></a>[293]</span>
abhors a vacuum, but he <em>had</em> already discovered
the principle of the thermometer. The data
from the readings of these two instruments form
the base of all meteorological science. Their inventors
as little appreciated the value of their discoveries
as they dreamed of the coming great western
empire which should first use their instruments
to measure the inception and development of storms,
and later, with the aid of the electro-magnetic
telegraph, to give warnings to threatened regions
of the approach of hurricanes, cold waves, floods,
and frosts that have been worth at least one hundred
million dollars to this country during the past
ten years without counting the many thousands
of lives saved among mariners.</p>

<p>Doctor John Lining, of Charleston, South Carolina,
kept a daily record of the temperature in this
country as early as 1738, although the accurate
thermometers of Fahrenheit had then been in use
but a few years and the errors due to imperfect
mechanical construction may have been considerable
as compared with the refined instruments
now used for measuring temperature. About one
hundred years after the invention of the barometer,
viz., in 1747, Benjamin Franklin, the patriot
and statesman, the diplomat, the scientist, divined<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_294"></a>[294]</span>
that certain storms may move in a direction opposite
to the blowing of the wind and that they progress
in an easterly direction. It was prophetic
that this idea should come to him long before
any one had ever seen charts showing observations
simultaneously taken at many stations. But although
his ideas in this respect were more momentous
than his act of drawing the lightning from the
clouds and identifying it with the electricity of the
laboratory, yet his contemporaries thought little
of his philosophy of storms, and it was soon forgotten.
It will be interesting to learn how he
reached his conclusion as to the cyclonic or eddy-like
nature of storms. He had arranged with a
co-worker at Boston to take observations of an
eclipse at the same time that Franklin was taking
readings at Philadelphia. Early on the evening
of the eclipse an unusually severe northeast wind
and rainstorm set in at Philadelphia and Franklin
was unable to secure any observations. He reasoned
that as the wind blew fiercely from the northeast
the storm, of course, was coming from that direction,
and Boston must have experienced its ravages before
Philadelphia was reached. Reports indicated
that the storm was widespread. What was the
surprise of Franklin, when, after the slow passage of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_295"></a>[295]</span>
the mail by coach, he heard from his friend in
Boston that the night of the eclipse had been clear
and favorable for observations, but that a terrific
northeast wind and rainstorm began early the
following morning. Franklin then sent out inquiries
to surrounding stage stations and found that
at all places southwest of Philadelphia the storm
began earlier and that the greater the distance
the earlier the beginning as compared with its
advent in Philadelphia; but northeast of Philadelphia
the time of the beginning of the storm was
later than at the latter city, the storm not reaching
Boston until twelve hours after it began at Philadelphia.
In considering these facts a line of inductive
reasoning brought him to the conclusion that the wind
always blows towards the center of the storm;
that the northeast storm which Boston and Philadelphia
had experienced was caused by the suction
exercised by an advancing storm eddy from the
west which drew the air rapidly from Boston toward
Philadelphia, while the source of the attraction—the
center of the storm eddy—was yet a thousand
miles to the southwest of the latter place; that
the velocity of the northeast wind increased as the
center of the storm eddy advanced nearer and
nearer from the southwest until the wind reached<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_296"></a>[296]</span>
the conditions of a hurricane; that the wind between
Boston and Philadelphia shifted its direction
so as to come from the southwest after the center of
the storm eddy had passed over this region; and
that the force of the wind gradually decreased as
the center of attraction—which always is the storm
center—passed farther and farther away to the
northeast.</p>

<p>Another man whose name is dear to the heart of
every patriotic American conducted, in conjunction
with a friend, a series of weather observations, beginning
in 1771 and continued during the stirring
times of the Revolution. This was the sage of
Monticello, Thomas Jefferson.</p>

<p>During the first half of the nineteenth century,
nearly a hundred years after Franklin’s northeast
rainstorm, Redfield, Espy, Loomis, Henry, and
other American scientists laboriously gathered by
mail the data of storms after their passage and
demonstrated their principal motions to be such
as Franklin had supposed. Professor Joseph Henry,
Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution, in 1855,
constructed the first daily weather map from simultaneous
observations collected by telegraph. He
did not publish his forecast but used his large wall
map for the purpose of demonstrating the feasibility<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_297"></a>[297]</span>
of organizing a Government weather service. If
there were no other achievements to the credit of
the institution founded in this country through the
benevolence of the English philanthropist, James
Smithson, who, by the way, never gazed upon our
fair land, the work of the Smithsonian Institution
in connection with practical meteorology would
always give it a warm place in the hearts of those
who believe the crowning achievements of science
consist in giving to the world knowledge which
results in the saving of human life, the amelioration
of the sufferings of human beings, and the acceleration
of the wheels of commerce and industry.</p>

<p>Although American scientists were the pioneers
in discovering the progressive character of storms
and in demonstrating the practicability of weather
services, the United States was the fourth Government
to give legal autonomy to a weather service.
Holland established a weather service, with telegraph
reports and forecasts, in 1860; England
followed with a smaller service in 1861; and France
in 1863. But none of these countries has an area
from which observations can be collected great
enough to give such a synoptic picture of storms as
is necessary in the making of forecasts of much utility.
It would require an international service, embracing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_298"></a>[298]</span>
all the countries of Europe, to equal, in extent of the
area covered and of the accuracy of its forecasts, the
service of the United States, which was begun in
1870, as the result of agitation by Lapham, Henry,
Abbe, Maury, and others.</p>

<p>The vast region now brought under the dominion
of twice daily synchronous observations embraces
an area extending two thousand miles north and
south, three thousand miles east and west, and so
fortunately located in the interest of the meteorologist
as to include an important arc on the circum-polar
thoroughfare of storms of the northern hemisphere.
Simultaneous observations, collected twice
daily by telegraph from two hundred stations,
distributed throughout this great area, renders it
possible at several central offices, where all the
reports are received, to present to the trained eye
of the forecaster a wonderful panoramic picture
of atmospheric conditions. Each twelve hours the
kaleidoscope changes and a new graphic picture of
actual changes is shown. The movements of storm
centers and cold-wave areas are noted and estimates
made as to their probable course during the next
twenty-four hours. Where else can the meteorologist
find such an opportunity to study storms and
atmospheric changes?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_299"></a>[299]</span></p>

<p>In 1870, and for ten years thereafter, our forecasts
and storm warnings were looked upon by the
press and the people more as experiments than as
serious statements. The newspapers especially were
prone to facetiously comment on the forecasts, and
many were clamorous for the abolition of the service
during the first years of its existence. There was
some ground for the criticisms. We knew nearly
as much about the mechanics of storms at that time
as we do to-day, but we had not, by a daily watching
of the inception, the development, and the
progression of storms, trained a corps of expert
forecasters, such as now form a part of the staff of
the Chief of the Weather Bureau, and from which
the writer was graduated before he became Chief.
Along about 1880, mariners began to note that
danger signals were, in far more than a majority of
cases, followed by heavy winds; they began to
reason that it would be better to take precaution
against storms that never came, than to be unprepared
for those which did come according to the
forecasts.</p>

<p>It is a fact that many times, by the operation of
forces not indicated by the surface readings, the
barometer at the center of a storm begins to rise and
the velocity of the whirling mass to decrease. In<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_300"></a>[300]</span>
such a case the storm signals placed in advance of
the storm center would fail to give the proper information.
Again, the storm center may suddenly
acquire a force not anticipated, or it may pursue a
track considerably divergent from the normal for
the location and season. In this case, also, the
forecasts may warn some cities that fail to receive
the effects of the storm. However, during the
past few years the staff of the Weather Bureau,
which includes the ablest meteorologists in the
United States, has made a study of the peculiarities
of the different types of storms occurring in the
different localities during the various seasons of
the year, their line of travel and the force they may
be expected to attain. Competitive examinations
have been held to test the comparative merits of
those who, by natural ability, are best fitted to
correctly and quickly correlate in their minds the
conditions shown on a meteorological chart, and to
make accurate <ins class="corr" id="tn-300" title="Transcriber’s Note—Original text: 'deductions thereform'">
deductions therefrom</ins> as to the development,
movement, and force of storms. This
line of work and investigation has resulted in improved
forecasts; so much so that mariners now
universally heed the storm warnings; horticulturists
and truck gardeners make ample provision for
protection against frost; the shippers of perishable<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_301"></a>[301]</span>
produce give full credence to the cold wave
predictions. Of the many West Indian hurricanes
which have swept our Atlantic seaboard from Florida
to Maine during the past many years, not one has
reached a single seaport without danger warnings
being sent well in advance of the storm; and few unnecessary
warnings have been issued. The result
is that few disasters of consequence have occurred.
Large owners of marine property estimate that one
of these severe storms traversing our Atlantic
coast in the absence of danger signals would leave
not less than three million dollars’ worth of wreckage.
Twice a census was taken just after the passage of
severe hurricanes to determine the value of property
held in port by the danger warning sent out in advance
of the storms. In one case the figure was
placed at thirty-four million dollars and in the
other thirty-eight million dollars. Of course this
does not represent the value of property saved.
It simply shows the value of property placed in
positions of safety as a result of the danger signals
and warning messages sent to masters.</p>

<p>On January 1, 1898, an extensive cold wave swept
from the Rocky Mountains eastward to the seaboard.
Estimates secured from shippers in a hundred
principal cities indicate that property valued<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_302"></a>[302]</span>
at three million four hundred thousand dollars was
saved as a direct result of the predictions sent out well
in advance of the coming of the severe cold. The
utility of these forecasts to the agriculture, the commerce,
and the industry of the country is so great that
there is hardly a daily paper that does not publish
weather forecasts in a prominent place, and there is
scarcely a reader who fails to note the predictions.</p>

<p>Twenty-five years ago mariners on our Great
Lakes and seaboard depended on their own weather
lore to warn them of coming storms. Then, although
the number of craft plying our waters was
much less than now, every severe storm that
swept the Lakes or Atlantic coast left destruction
and death in its wake, and for days afterward the
dead were cast up by the receding waves, and the
shores were lined with wreckage. Happily this is
not now the case, for the Weather Bureau is ever
watching the changes of atmospheric conditions, and
giving to the mariner warning of coming storms.
Each observer telegraphs instantly to the Central
Office whenever the delicately adjusted instruments
at his station show unusual agitation. By this
means the inception of many storms is detected
when the regular morning and evening reports fail
to give notice of their origin.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_303"></a>[303]</span></p>

<p>Some idea of the vast interests floating on the
Atlantic coast may be had when it is stated that
5628 trans-Atlantic steamers, with an aggregate
of 10,076,148 tons, and 5842 sailing craft, aggregating
2,105,688 tons, entered and left ports on
the Atlantic seaboard during a single year ten years
ago, and the record is vastly greater now. The
value of their cargoes is more than a billion and a
half of dollars. Our coastwise traffic is enormous.
Fifteen years ago more than seventeen thousand
sailing vessels and four thousand steamers entered
and left the ports between Maine and Florida. The
number has largely increased since. From these
facts one can roughly measure the value of the marine
property which the Weather Bureau aims to protect
by giving warning of approaching storms.</p>

<p>It is the expectation of the meteorologist that
some day he will be able to accurately forecast the
weather for weeks and months in advance. What
a wonderful conservation of human energy would
result if it were possible to tell the farmer when the
great corn and wheat belts would have abundant
rain during the next growing season, or when
droughts would parch and wither the vegetation;
or to truthfully inform the planter of the South
that the coming season would be favorable or unfavorable<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_304"></a>[304]</span>
for the production of cotton! Effort
could be withheld in one part of the country, and
greater energy exerted in another.</p>

<p>This extension of forecasting doubtless will be
accomplished as the result of further study of solar
impulses which disturb the orderly processes of the
earth’s atmosphere and initiate storms, combined
with a comparative study of meteorological data.
We may be laying the foundation of a great edifice
which shall adorn the civilization of future centuries.</p>

<p>As storms of more or less intensity pass over large
portions of our country every few days during the
greater part of the year, and as it is seldom that the
weather report does not show one or more storms as
operating somewhere within our broad domain,
it is easy for some charlatan to forecast thunderstorms
about a certain time in July, or a cold wave
and snow about a certain period in January, and
stand a fair chance to accidentally become famous
as a prophet. One may select any three equidistant
dates in January and forecast high wind, snow,
and cold for New York City, and stand a fair chance
of having the fraudulent forecast verified in two
out of the three cases, provided that you claim a
storm coming the day before or the day after one
of your dates is the storm that you expected.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_305"></a>[305]</span></p>

<p>From the introduction of the electro-magnetic
telegraph in 1844 down to 1869 intermittent advocations
were made by many in this country for
a national weather service. Finally Doctor Increase
A. Lapham, of Milwaukee, scientist and philanthropist,
so aroused the property and financial interests
of the country with the facts that he presented
relative to the destruction of life and property by
storms on Lake Michigan that Congress, under
provisions of a bill introduced by General Halbert
E. Paine, was induced to appropriate money to
initiate a service. To General Albert J. Meyer,
Chief Signal Officer, U. S. A., was intrusted the duty
of inaugurating a tentative weather service by
deploying over the country as observers the military
signalmen of his command. From this beginning
has evolved the present extensive Weather
Bureau, which is the largest in the world and more
intimately serves the needs of the public than any
other.</p>

<p>In 1869 Professor Cleveland Abbe published a
weather bulletin at Cincinnati, based upon simultaneous
observations secured by telegraph from
about thirty stations. He was the first scientific
assistant to General Meyer and remained continuously
with the service until his death in 1919.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_306"></a>[306]</span>
Colonel (afterward Brigadier-General) H. H. C.
Dunwoody, U. S. A., served twenty-seven years as
an expert forecaster or as the assistant chief of the
Weather Bureau. General A. W. Greely, of Arctic
fame, the last of the military chiefs, succeeded
Brigadier-General William B. Hazen on the death
of the latter. Professor Mark W. Harrington was
the first chief of the new civil Weather Bureau; he
served but four years and was succeeded by Professor
Willis L. Moore, who remained chief for
eighteen years, serving two years under President
Cleveland, who appointed him, and during the entire
administrations of McKinley, Roosevelt, and Taft,
and was removed by Woodrow Wilson immediately
on taking office. Professor Moore claims the honor
of having been the first presidential appointee to
incur the displeasure and receive the public condemnation
of Woodrow Wilson. The present chief is
Professor Charles F. Marvin, who for many years
served as an assistant to Professor Moore.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_2" href="#FNanchor_2" class="label">[2]</a> The author wishes that this were literally true, for he believes that
no great man or great woman ever was born from a mother with a painted
face, dyed lips, false hair, and a body pitifully distorted by ungracefully
ambling about in high heeled shoes. The power of suggestion is so great
in its influence on the plastic mind of youth that a mother who is little
else than a perambulating falsehood will leave descendants wanting in
many if not all of the attributes of manly and womanly virtues.</p>
